         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the ſpiritual diſcerning Reader.</head>
            <p>MY beloved ſpiritual brethren, in whom is rooted and really grounded the ſaving light of Life eternal, I know that the manifold breakings forth of ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing glorious appearances in this Age can by no means be hid from your eyes.</p>
            <p>Alſo you know that the true light of Life hath almoſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered them all to be nothing elſe but the very depth of mens ſerpentine ſubtilties, cloaked over with the divine titles of the moſt infinite and holy God, ſo that mens glittering language now is of no value unto you, unleſs the holy Spirit beareth witneſs unto your ſpirits, that the Lord hath ſpoken unto them from heaven, neither can men blinde your eyes with their natural miracles, artificial juglings, ſophiſtical ſigns and wonders, to cauſe you ever the ſooner for that to receive them as immediately ſent forth by the ever-living God.</p>
            <p>I ſay it is not lofty words of imaginary voices, viſions, dreams, revelations, variety of languages, declarations of the knowledge of the heights, and depths of periſhing na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, pretended Jeruſalem Journeys, ſuppoſed ſeeing of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Angels with eyes of natural fleſh, and familiar conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing with them, and knowing the names of all the holy An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in glory, and every mans protecting Angel in this world, or any ſuch like carnal fancies, can blinde your eyes any more which have received from above a diſtinguiſhing gift be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the things of eternal life and death, not onely from its effects, but from its firſt cauſes alſo.</p>
            <p>My ſelected brethren unto a pure light, language, and life, from the very true God I certainly know, that nothing in
<pb facs="tcp:103084:3"/>this world will ſatisfie your hungry ſouls, but a right under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſpiritual things which are eternal in that world to come; therefore unto you alone which look not after gilded words, but glorious things, preſent I this Epiſtle from that Spirit which can neither deceive, nor be deceived by men nor angels.</p>
            <p>Wherefore if any ſober man of a quick comprehenſion ſhall ſuppoſe that this Writing might have been compoſed into fewer words then is here inſerted, I hope he ſhall wiſely conſider that things of ſuch concernment requires more words then ordinary, not onely for informing and confirming of the ſimple Saints, but alſo for confounding of the ſubtile Serpents of this Age.</p>
            <p>Moreover, you that peruſe this Epiſtle which are of an unjudging tender ſpirit, may alſo know, that before the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit in Chriſt Jeſus became my Miniſter, I was very weak in the knowledge of learned mens Opinions, their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes or Writings concerning heavenly things which are hid from them, and revealed unto unlearned babes.</p>
            <p>Therefore the chief deſire of my ſoul is, that it may be manifeſted unto elect men and Angels, whether the ſubſtance of this Epiſtle proceeds from mine own carnal ſpirit, or from the moſt pure and holy Spirit of God himſelf, I mean that one perſonal glorious Majeſty of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, whoſe divine nature both is, and ſhall be Crowns of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal raviſhing Excellencies in all his elect, at the great and dreadful Day of eternal burning vengeance upon the ſouls and bodies of all bloody-minded impenitent Perſecutors that ever were born.</p>

            <head>Another Epiſtle annexed to this Book.</head>
            <p>My beloved ſpiritual Brethren, who are, or ſhall come to be really grounded in the true Doctrine, which is held forth in the three Commiſsions, namely the Commiſsion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. <hi>2</hi> Of Chriſt Jeſus and the Apoſtles. <hi>3</hi> Of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Spirit; which Commiſſion is now extant in the world, though not accompanied with viſible ſigns, and natural miracles as the other two Commiſſions had in their time, when their Commiſſion was in being; yet this I am ſure, that this Commiſſion of the Spirit being the laſt Commiſſion that God will ever ſend into this world, while time is no more; therefore it is that this Commiſſion of the Spirit hath the onely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the two former Commiſſions: for there is no man in the world at this day, let him be of what Sect or Opinion ſoever, that doth truly know any part of the Scriptures, but this Commiſſion of the Spirit onely, notwithſtanding they labor ſo much after the knowledge of them; yet for wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of a Commiſſion from God, they have no true underſtanding of any one principal or true ground of faith; for all that they do of that nature is nothing elſe but the very ſtrength of reaſon, and reaſon can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver truly know the deep things of eternity; becauſe there is no man in the world at this day that hath the knowledge of the true God, his Form and Nature, the right devil, his form and nature, but this Commiſſion of the Spirit onely.</p>
            <p>Therefore when God ſpake theſe words unto <hi>John Reeve,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I have given thee underſtanding of my minde in the Scriptures, above all the men in the world.</hi> Alſo God did ſay at the ſame time, <hi>I have given thee</hi> Lodowick Muggleton <hi>to be thy mouth:</hi> So that according to the words of God, he hath given us two to underſtand more of his mind in the Scriptures, then all the men in the world do at this day, that is, more ſpiritual knowledge of the Scriptures than all the men in the world, becauſe God hath choſen us two to be his laſt Commiſſionated Prophets and Witneſſes of the Spirit, to declare and make known unto the Seed of Faith thoſe great myſteries which have layen hid in the breaſt of God ever ſince the foundation of this world was laid; and in the time of their Commiſſion was in ſome meaſure made manifeſt unto the ſons of men, by
<pb facs="tcp:103084:4"/>ſome part of the myſtery of God, as thoſe Commiſſions aforeſaid, namely, <hi>Moſes</hi> and Jeſus.</p>
            <p>But now in this laſt Age is the Commiſſion of the Spirit, which is to <hi>finiſh the myſtery of God,</hi> accordi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g to that ſaying of <hi>John,</hi> Rev. <hi>10.</hi> and <hi>7.</hi> where it is ſaid, <hi>But in the days of the voice of the ſeventh Angel when he ſhall begin to ſound, the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, as he hath declared to his ſervants the Prophets.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now this myſtery of God is made manifeſt in the world by this Commiſſion of the Spirit both in our Diſcourſe and Writings: ſo that it may be clear to you that are capable to underſtand, and to comprehend thoſe deep and high myſteries which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>th been declared by this Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Spirit, both by word of mouth and pen; wherein we have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded the myſtery of the true God, and the right Devil, with the perſons of Angels, and their natures, with many other ſacred myſteries, which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver were revealed unto the ſons of men, until this laſt Commiſsion of the Spirit.</p>
            <p>And the knowledge of the two Seeds is theſe two Keyes which doth open or unlock the gates of Heaven, and of Hell, that is, they know what the Commiſsion of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets was, and how far a man is freed from the viſible worſhip of his Commiſsion which was of the Law, which is the gates of Hell.</p>
            <p>Alſo we know what the other Commiſsion of Jeſus and the Apoſtles was, and how far a man is bound to obſerve the viſible Worſhip which was ſet up in their time, which was then in great force ſo long as that Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſsion ſtood: but when God doth give a new Commiſsion, the old is made void, as with reference to the viſible Worſhip which is ſet up by a Commiſsion; therefore you know that the Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſtles Commiſsion did wholly thruſt out the viſible Worſhip which was ſet up by <hi>Moſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore it was that Chriſt ſaid unto <hi>Peter, I have given thee the keyes of heaven and of hell,</hi> that is, thou ſhalt be a Preacher of the Goſpel, which is the Kingdom of Heaven, and ſo thou ſhalt open the gates of Heaven unto all thoſe that ſhall believe in thy Declaration: Alſo thou ſhalt have the true interpreta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So likewiſe it is w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>th this Commiſsion of the Spirit, becauſe this Commiſsion of the Spiri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> doth hold forth no viſible nor external outward Worſhip, as the other two Commiſsions did.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:103084:4"/>
            <p>But as it is the Commiſsion of the Spirit, therefore there is no out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward nor viſible Worſhip to be uſed in it, but that inviſible and ſpiritual Worſhip onely, which is to worſhip God in ſpirit and truth; which ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Worſhip doth conſiſt in the knowledge of the true God, and the right Devil, upon which the foundations of the other two Commiſſions both ſtand upon, which no man in the world at this day doth, or can knovv, but this Commiſſion of the Spirit onely, and thoſe which come to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, and to believe the truth of this Commiſsion.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid in this thing, but it would be too large an Epiſtle; therefore my counſel and advice unto you that do believe, or ſhall come to believe in this laſt ſpiritual Commiſsion, is, that you would ſeriouſly read and peruſe this Book, called, <hi>A Divine Looking-Glaſs,</hi> though it hath been much ſleighted and diſregarded becauſe of the abuſe that it did receive in the Preſs, yet there is contained in it the moſt higheſt myſteries of all, which have not been revealed ſince the world be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, until now.</p>
            <p>But I having occaſion for to reprint it again, have read it over with much ſerious deliberation, and finding in it ſuch variety of matter, with ſuch deep profound myſteries, which could not be declared but by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Spirit of God which was given unto <hi>John Reeve;</hi> ſo that I hope that you that have received ſome light in your underſtandings concerning the myſtery of the true God, and the right Devil, upon the knowledge of which doth depend many other heavenly Myſteries which is treated upon in this Book, which I do deſire, and ſhall be glad that you may increaſe and grow in the knowledge of them ſo, that you may be ſatisfied in the full aſſurance of Faith while you are here, and your knowledge perfected in glory hereafter.</p>

               <p>My Chriſtian Brethren, theſe curious Queries will occaſion variety of ſpiritual matter, yea and it will further me alſo to treat upon the original of all heavenly ſecrets. Wherefore in anſwer to theſe difficult queries, I ſhall write of ſeveral things of moſt higheſt conſequence unto mankinde; namely, concerning the Glorious Creator himſelf, and the original cauſe that moved the Divine Majeſty to produce any creature ſenſibly to live in his ſight, and of the creation of the true God, and of the imaginary lying creation in the ſpirit of ſinful man, and whence it came. Alſo of the creation of Angels before man, with the materials and manner of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 I confeſs I have been moved briefly to touch upon moſt of theſe things to the publike view of many already, but now through aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the unerring Spirit, I ſhall handle them more fully, in remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving many obſtructions in the way, and for more clearer ſatisfaction unto the true ſpiritual Chriſtian, and confutation of all fleſhly lying Antichriſtians whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Firſt, by immediate inſpiration from the Holy Spirit, I poſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7 Secondly, with the ſame confidence I affirm againſt men or angels, that this our God from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> Eternity, was an uncreated ſpiritual perſon, in form like a man.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Thirdly, from the ſame ſpirit, I declare that that bleſſed God-man Chriſt Jeſus ſo exalted throughout the true Scriptures, was, and is that eternal Creator beforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Fourthly, I declare againſt all literal-mongers in this world, that this our Creator and gracious Redeemer was only one immortal, undivided perſonal God-man from all eternity, and in time, and to all eternity.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Fifthly, I declare from the holy Spirit, that the addition of two perſons more unto this our onely wiſe God, bleſſed for ever, proceeded onely from the old Serpentine Antichriſtian devil in carnal men.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Moreover, as for thoſe words of Father, Son, and Spirit, or Lord Jeſus Chriſt, or any other divine titles in Scriptures, you may know that they are onely variety of names to ſet forth the infinite God-head glory of the Creators perſon.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Again, I declare from the Spirit of truth, that from all Eternity, the Creators perſon was of a ſun-ſhining fiery glory of ſenſible heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly motion, light, heat, voyce, and ſpeech, and his divine perſon was ſwifter then thought.</p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:103084:6"/>
               <p n="13">13 Moreover all variety of divine excellencies, as a chriſtal Sea, did infinitely reign in his heavenly perſon: as namely, Pure Spiritual Faith, his Almighty Power, or heavenly Love, his raviſhing Glory, or any other divine vertue that can be named.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Thus you that are truely ſpiritual, may undoubtedly know, that from all Eternity, the Creator poſſeſſed his heavenly joyes or new glories by himſelf alone, when no created being ſenſibly appeared to behold his excellent Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="15">15 By true in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>piration from the holy ſpirit, I poſitively affirm, that the principal motion of all variety of heavenly wiſdom, joy, or glory, which the Creator foreſaw he ſhould eternally poſſeſs, naturally ſprang in him from an incomprehenſible knowledge of his own end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs infiniteneſs;</p>
               <p n="16">16 Or from a perfect underſtanding of an eternal increaſe of all manner of glorious excellencies to ſolace himſelf withal, and elect men and angels that ſhould be c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p n="17">17 If the Creator ſhould be an infinite formleſs ſpirit, as ſome men vainly imagine, my ſpiritual brethren, you know then that it were impoſſible for any ſpirit of man or angel, to be made capable of fixing his underſtanding upon any ſuch ſpiritual Creator.</p>
               <p n="18">18 You know that no man can deſcribe the form of an inviſible ſpirit, whether it be finit, or infinite, unleſs it be covered with a body or perſon.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Moreover you know alſo, that no man or angel can be made able in the leaſt to comprehend the nature of any ſpirit whatſoever that wants a diſtinct body or perſon of its own to inhabit in.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Therefore you cannot but underſtand that the Creator of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, muſt needs be a ſubſtantial glorious perſon, and not a non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantial formleſs ſpirit as beforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Again, notwithſtanding every divine vertue in the Creators perſon be infinite, yet by inſpiration from his own ſpirit, I poſitively affirm, that there was never any kinde of reaſon in him.</p>

               <p n="24">24 For this I ſay from the Lord, unto you that are ſpiritual, the very nature of reaſon though it be never ſo pure, is nothing elſe but meer deſire: therefore you may know, that if the Creator himſelf ſhould have any deſire in his ſpirit, there would be a kinde of want in him;</p>
               <p n="25">25 For if his na<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="26">26 Moreover my ſpiritual Brethren, what is the principal ground of all Antichriſtian darkneſs in the ſpirits of <hi>Solomon</hi>-like men, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to a right underſtanding of the Creator and his divine nature, is it not becauſe they think to appreh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>nd the true God, by a falſe light, which they vainly call pure reaſon?</p>
               <p n="27">27 What is this which worldly men call pure reaſon? is it any thing elſe but that proud angelical ſerpent devil in them, which by its own natural ſtrength continually ſtrives to finde out the tree of eternal life, that they may cure themſelves of their deadly wounds of ſoul, ariſing from all their ſpiritual and fleſhly rebellions againſt God and man?</p>
               <p n="28">28 Again, doth the true underſtanding of the Creator run in the line of pure reaſon, or pure faith in the Scriptures?</p>
               <p n="29">29 Is there any ſaying in Scripture, that Gods divine Nature is pure reaſon, or by pure reaſon we know the true God, or any thing that is ſpiritual? Indeed I have read Scriptures that ſay, <hi>By faith the Apoſtles knew the worlds were made; and by faith they knew their mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal bodies ſhould be raiſed immortal bodies at the great day of the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in his glory;</hi> but as beforeſaid, I never read or heard any ſpiritual wiſe man ſay, that the inviſible things of eternity were under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by mans pure reaſon, no nor Angels that behold the glorious Creator face to face.

               <p n="8">8 My beloved brethren, you may know that this muſt needs be an error, becauſe you know that the word <hi>Create,</hi> is to make formleſs dead matter into ſenſible living forms.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Beſides this, you know, as for creating of thoſe elements of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or duſt, there is no Scripture maketh mention of any ſuch thing, therefore a meer imagination; but more of this in the 6. Chapter.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Again you know, that from eternity the divine nature of the Creators ſpirit was nothing but immortal fiery glory of life and light: It is written, <hi>God is light, and in him there is no darkneſs at all.</hi> and it is written in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1. <hi>And darkneſs was upon the deep.</hi>

               <p n="11">11 My Brethren, if the Creator be all life and light, as you know he is, then without controverſie the dead earth and dark deep water never proceeded out of his glorious mouth: but if that Scripture ſhould be objected where it is ſaid, <hi>I create light, and I create dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> to that I anſwer: The mind of the holy Spirit in thoſe words was this: that he created thoſe ſouls that were naturally dark, and he created theſe mortal ſpirits that were full of immortal light: but on the contrary there was not the leaſt meaning in thoſe words or any other throughout the Scriptures, that God created or gave any being or beginning unto dead, dark, ſenſleſs earth and water, as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p n="16">16 So that it was the fore-knowledge of his own mighty power, which was one of the principal grounds that moved him to produce and living creature in his preſence.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Wherefore before any creature was formed by him, if he had not perfectly known that of thoſe aforeſaid elements of duſt or water by his word ſpeaking onely, he could create as many ſeveral ſpirits, with bodies ſutable to their natures, as he ſaw good, and yet wholly retain the divine nature of his ſpirit to himſelf, he would never have formed any creature to have lived in his ſight:</p>
               <p n="18">18 Becauſe then, you know, there would have been no diſtinction of natures or names between the creatures themſelves and the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, nor none of the variety of his infinite wiſdom, power, and glory, ever ſeen or known by the creatures;</p>
               <p n="19">19 For you that are ſpiritual may underſtand, that the Creators Royal will or pleaſure, was that glorious wheel that moved him to form any creature at all.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Therefore you may alſo know, that it was impoſſible for him to create the ſpirits of Angels and man to be both of the nature of his own ſpirit, or neither of them to be of his divine nature, becauſe as aforeſaid, the variety of his wiſdom, power, and glory, would have been all loſt for want of diſtinction.</p>

               <p n="33">33 Alſo you know that the Creators ſpirit being variety of ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual perfections, he could create nothing againſt his glory, but for his glory onely, becauſe that glory of his is himſelf, or his all in all, or onely pillar upon which he built his everlaſting kingdom;</p>
               <p n="34">34 Wherefore if angels or man had been framed in unchangeable conditions, then in ſtead of making known his manifold divine glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to his creatures, he muſt have created things for his own eternal ruine.</p>

               <p n="36">36 Moreover, if the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould be divided into three divine Perſons, as many men blindly imagine, then you know that being all eternal, they muſt of neceſſity be equal in God-head, wiſdom, power, and glory: A kingdom thus divided cannot ſtand.</p>
               <p n="37">37 For you that are truly ſpiritual know, that all the true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets in the time of the Law did never acknowledge any more Gods then that Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely, and by inſpiration they attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted many holy Names unto his divine Majeſty, for the exaltation of his glorious perſon, above all angels and men.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="8">8 My beloved brethren, you may ſee that the Apoſtles came not to underſtand ſpiritual things by their ſtudy in the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, but by a gift from the Holy Ghoſt they were ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in a great meaſure to comprehend the inviſible things of God which they ſhould enjoy in the reſurrection of the juſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Moreover you know, that the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> before his conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, was a very able man in the letter of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, yea and according to the letter blameleſs in his converſation, yet for all that in zeal towards an unknown God, he perſecuted the ſpirit of that letter through ignorance of that ſecond man, which was the Lord from heaven.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Tis truth, that when the Apoſtles preached the ſpiritual things of eternity, they alluded unto <hi>Moſes</hi> and the true Prophets, becauſe ſome of thoſe myſteries were fore-propheſied of by them: but yet you may ſee that they were not inſtructed in thoſe heavenly things by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of their prophetical letter, but as beforeſaid, by inſpiration from the holy ſpirit onely.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Thus you that are ſpiritual may clearly ſee, that no man by his natural reaſon and ſtudy in the letter of the Scripture, can ever be eſtabliſhed in the truth of thoſe glorious things, unto which the letter

               <p n="13">13 My beloved ſpiritual brethren in the glorious things of eternity, though men ſeemingly appear never ſo innocent in their way, is it probable think you, that thoſe men are immediately moved to ſpeak unto the people by the ſpirit of God, that ſlight all the Scripture Records as a thing of nought?</p>
               <p n="14">14 I humbly beſeech you that are ſober, can any man of what tongue or language ſoever, ſpeak or write a better, or as good a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as the Scriptures are, and not ſpeak Scripture words, or prove it was not the glorious God that moved the holy men of old to ſpeak or write theſe Scripture records?</p>

               <p n="3">3 Alſo you may remember, that out of thoſe elements I have told you by inſpiration from an unerring ſpirit, that the Divine Majeſty hath created all things that were made, into that heavenly order they appear to be, whether for a time, or for eternity.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Moreover it is clear alſo, that without thoſe eternal materials, was nothing made that was made, neither poſſibly could be, onely that ſerpentine devil in the learned men of this world, have long imagined a confuſed creation of more ſeeming wiſdom, power, and glory, then that of the Creator, as abundantly beforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Again, concerning the word <hi>Create,</hi> make or form, I ſhall write a little of the ſenſe of it.</p>
               <p n="6">6 My beloved brethren, the very true meaning of that word <hi>Create,</hi> is to compoſe confuſed dead matter into compleat living forms; or that word <hi>Create</hi> is light and life, producing dark dead d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="7">7 Again, ſeeing unlearned ſpiritual men wreſt the Scripture to their own deſtruction, therefore for our more cleerer underſtanding of the true Creator, in order thereunto, I ſhall ſpeak ſomewhat of the viſible heavens, and the lights formed in them for mans natural com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, next unto the Creators glory.</p>
               <p n="8">8 My beloved ſpiritual brethren, you know concerning the deep waters throughout the Scripture Records, no man can finde one word or tittle in reference to its beginning, therefore of neceſſity it muſt be eternal.</p>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:103084:19"/>
               <p n="9">9 Likewiſe you know, that the waters covered the earth before the creation, wherefore the earth being as it is in the deep waters, of neceſſity muſt needs be one eſſence eternally with thoſe deep wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Therefore though it be ſaid, <hi>In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth, and the earth was without form and void, and darkneſs was upon the deep, and the ſpirit of God moved upon the waters;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11 My ſpiritual brethren, you cannot be deceived by literal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretations, as to think that the deep waters might be eternal, but that lump of hid earth within thoſe waters had a beginning by the word of the Lord:</p>
               <p n="12">12 No, you know that is againſt all ſober ſenſe or reaſon it ſelf, for if that earth which was within the water proceeded from the word of the Lord, then the dark deep water muſt of neceſſity have its beginning alſo at that time the earth received its being, becauſe in the lump they were eſſentially one.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Wherefore what ever man in darkneſs have dreamed, as to ſay that God created all things of nothing, or that God created that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed chaos of water and earth, it is ſo far from having any truth in it, that it is all one as if they ſhould ſay, there is no Creator at all, but ea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="14">14 Again, by inſpiration from an unerring ſpirit, I poſitively af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm againſt men or angels, that the earth and the deep water were eternally one chaos of confuſed matter diſtinct from the ever-living God.</p>
               <p n="15">15 And whereas it is ſaid, <hi>In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth,</hi> that is, out of that matter of water and earth that were formleſs and void, God did by a word ſpeaking, create a formable world, as a place of convenient reſidence for mortals to inhabit in.</p>
               <p n="16">16 I alſo declare from the holy Spirit, that God created no light nor darkneſs at all without bodies;</p>
               <p n="17">17 Wherefore concerning thoſe words, <hi>Then God ſaid, Let there be light, and there was light,</hi> that is, the ſpirit of God being all light, moving or ſpeaking into the deep dark waters, his word cauſed a light to appear throughout thoſe waters, to make a diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween light, and that utter darkneſs that was both in the deep water and the earth, incloſed as a priſoner in the womb of darkneſs:</p>
               <p n="18">18 So that the Lord called this created light, <hi>Day;</hi> not onely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was all darkneſs before, or that he did not purpoſe to form a

               </p>
               <p n="20">20 Or you may know, that the very word <hi>Light</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Day,</hi> as the word <hi>Darkneſs</hi> ſignifieth <hi>Night.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 Likewiſe you know, that darkneſs was not darkneſs without its body; therefore you may know, that light can be no light unleſs it be in a body alſo.</p>
               <p n="22">22 It is not the word <hi>Light,</hi> nor the word <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> is, or poſſibly can be any thing at all, unleſs they be in diſtinct bodies, that they might become abſolute beings of light, or beings of darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="23">23 It is written, <hi>Aga<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p n="24">24 My ſpiritual brethren, I declare from the holy Spirit, that this viſible Firmament called <hi>Heaven,</hi> was formed by the powerful word of the Creator, out of thoſe very waters, in which it is now fixed, to keep them aſunder.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Moreover it is written, <hi>And God ſaid, Let there be Lights in the Firmament of the heaven to give light upon the earth, and it was ſo. God then made two great Lights, the greater light to rule the day, and the leſſer light to rule the night. He made alſo the Stars, and God ſet them in the firmament of heaven, to ſhine upon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26 My ſpiritual brethren, whatſoever hath been written formerly from mens imaginations concerning the vaſtneſs of the bodies of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, it aroſe in them from their utter darkneſs of that glorious Creator, from whence all true light proceeds.</p>
               <p n="27">27 Wherefore from that Light by whom no man ever was decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, in ſome meaſure I ſhall demonſtrate why the Lord called the Sun and Moon two great Lights, and of that matter of which they were made.</p>
               <p n="28">28 My ſpiritual brethren, though the Sun, Moon, and Stars tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend each other in glory, yet you may know that they were all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of that element of water, and are diſtinct bodies of light fixed in the heavenly firmament.</p>
               <p n="29">29 I do not mean that they are ſo fixed, as to be uncapable of motion; but of the contrary from the Lord I affirm, that the Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſelf is not capable of motion, but by the word of the Lord that formed it, it is made unmoveable until the day of its diſſolution, and thoſe bodies of Sun, Moon, and Stars, motions in that firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:103084:20"/>heaven in their ſeaſons, to fulfil that word of Government in them.</p>
               <p n="30">30 For you that are ſpiritual may know, that the firmament of heaven, and thoſe Rulers of Sun, Moon, and Stars ſet in them, as to govern both the day and the night, may be compared to a Prince, with his Nobles, Throne, and other inferior Rulers.</p>
               <p n="31">31 For you know, that his kingdom whereon they have their li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving being is unmoveable, but the Governours do the work unto which they are appointed.</p>
               <p n="32">32 My brethren, you may underſtand alſo, that the firmamental body above us, or below us, if you think it ſo, for its appointed ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, is as firmly fixed, as the earth we tread on: and as things in power are motional on this earth, ſo likewiſe thoſe created lights are onely motional in that heavenly body aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Again it is ſaid, <hi>That God ſet them in the firmament of heaven to ſhine upon the earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="34">34 My brethren, hearken no more unto vain Aſtronomers or Star-gazers concerning the bulk of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, for I poſitively affirm from that God that made them, that the compaſs of their bodies are not much bigger then they appear to our natural ſight.</p>
               <p n="35">35 <hi>O empty vain liars! how long have you been ſuffered to deceive the people with your monſtrous imaginary bodies of Sun, Moon, and Stars, which are not? and of your great knowledge concerning them; your things are too big to be good or true, and the time of your ſerpentine Sophiſtry is almoſt finiſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="36">36 Again, I declare from the holy Spirit, that the bodies of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, are all diſtinct beings from each other, and poſſeſs their own created light alone, neither borrowing nor lending their light to one another, what ever hath been imagined to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, concerning New Moons or Eclipſes.</p>
               <p n="37">37 Again you know, the Scriptures do not ſay, that the Sun and Moon are two great bodies, but two great lights onely: Neither doth the Scripture ſay, that the bodies of the Global Earth and Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Firmament, are covered with the vaſtneſs of the Sun, Moon, or Stars, or that they incloſe any other bodies within their own bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies; or that any other bodies are fixed in them:</p>
               <p n="38">38 But on the contrary the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That the Sun and Moon were ſet in the firmament of Heaven, to ſhine upon the earth:</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:103084:21"/>it is as clear as the light, that that which is fixed is of a leſs bulk than that wherein it is incloſed.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Yet you know that the greater bulk may receive its principal light from that leſſer body within its circumference, as a rich diamond in a Ring, or a Candle or Torch in the night in a wide room, or the like.</p>
               <p n="40">40 My ſpiritual brethren, you may underſtand that the glory of the moſt high God conſiſts not in bulk of things, but in the exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brightneſs of them.</p>
               <p n="41">41 Nay moreover you cannot but know, that the infinite wiſdom of the Divine Majeſty, doth the more abundantly appear in an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary light ſhining from a very little body.</p>
               <p n="42">42 My brethren, it is not the bulk of the Sun or Moon which cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth ſo great a light, but as aforeſaid, it is the tranſcendent bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their created purities, which diſplayeth thoſe beams of light through the viſible heaven and earth.</p>
               <p n="43">43 What ever hath, or ſhall be ſaid to the contrary, from the Lord I poſitively affirm, that the bodies of the Sun, Moon, and Stars, are all fixed beings, onely in one firmament.</p>
               <p n="44">44 Moreover from the Lord of glory I declare, that this viſible Heaven is all the Firmaments that ever was formed by the Creator.</p>
               <p n="45">45 Furthermore, though the bodies of the Sun and Moon were both formed out of that element of water, yet they were made as contrary in their natures as fire and water.</p>
               <p n="46">46 Becauſe you know their government were over contrary beings, the one to rule the day, and the other to rule the night; ſo that as the Sun is a fiery glorious light for conſolation unto the natural things of the day, ſo likewiſe the Moon is a qualifying cold watry light, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable to the watry things of the night:</p>
               <p n="47">47 Wherefore, though the body of the Sun is of a more eminent brightneſs than that of the Moon, yet they being of contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, it is againſt all ſober reaſon, that the one ſhould receive any light from the other in the leaſt.</p>
               <p n="48">48 Again you know, that when the bodies of the Sun and Moon ſeem cloſe together, in ſtead of any agreement between them, there is ſuch a fiery conteſt, as if they would abſolutely deſtroy each other. And what think you is the juſt occaſion of it? is it not the difference of their natures?</p>
               <p n="49">49 Can fire and water, or light and darkneſs agree, if they be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:103084:21"/>together? is there any reſt unto either of them until one of them is diſſolved?</p>
               <p n="50">50 My beloved friends in the pure truth, what ever men have long declared concerning the Eclipſe of the Sun, through the near appearance of the Moon, you may underſtand, that the true occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Sun eclipſed, whether in part or whole, is according to their appearing at a further or nearer diſtance unto each other;</p>
               <p n="51">51 For, as beforeſaid, the nature of the one being fiery, hot, and dry, and the nature of the other being watry, cold, and moiſt, if the moſt high God had not decreed the time of their conteſt, when they are nearly conjoyned, there would be no communion between them until one of them were utterly diſſolved.</p>
               <p n="52">52 Again, is it not as clear as the light it ſelf unto us, that the true occaſion of all variance between created beings, whether ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or inſenſible, ariſeth onely from a difference of natures or ſpirits in them?</p>
               <p n="53">53 Moreover, when any kind of natures are ſutable to each other, is there not a ſweet harmony between them?</p>
               <p n="54">54 Wherefore if the Moon received her light from the Sun, as natural wiſe men have long imagined, is it not againſt all ſenſe or reaſon, that there ſhould be no union between them, but at a diſtance?</p>
               <p n="55">55 Doth it not rather agree with all true ſenſe, that if the one received her light from the other, that the more nearer they are in bodily appearance, the more greater harmony would enſue, and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the leſſer light rather to ſhine more clearly, than darken each others brightneſs?</p>
               <p n="56">56 I think that <hi>William Lilly</hi> and his learned brethren in Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gian figures, dare not ſay, <hi>that either the Sun or the Moon were ever at variance with their own ſelves;</hi> or, <hi>that the Eclipſes of the Sun or Moon proceedeth from any harmony between that which occaſioneth the Eclipſe, and the thing ſo eclipſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="57">57 Well then, if they acknowledge this rational truth, without controverſie, when the light of the Sun is eclipſed from us, it is through its near conjunction with the natural light or ruler of things of the night.</p>
               <p n="58">58 And when the light of the Moon is eclipſed from us, though it be in the night, or early in the morning, it is through her near <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <argument>
                  <p>An exact Scripture rule to prove the Man Chriſt glorified, to be Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in one diſtinct Perſon.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MY beloved brethren, which deſire a right underſtanding of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual things in Scripture Records, take ſpecial notice of this one thing, and you cannot be deceived by all the wiſdom or ſubtilty of men.</p>
               <p n="2">2 I ſay again from the Lord, take good notice of thoſe Scriptures which ſpeak poſitively concerning God, or the higheſt Heavens, or Angels, or eternal Life, or eternal Death, or of a natural Heaven, and all mortal things within its orb; why? becauſe you may know that all privative Scriptures, though never ſo eminent or numerous, wholly depend upon poſitive Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="3">3 My dear brethren, for whom my ſoul is in continual travel un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the pure truth be rooted in you, ſome of you being weak of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, I ſhall write variety of expreſſions for explaining my meaning in this weighty thing.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Again I ſay, thoſe Scripture-ſayings which are poſitive, though never ſo few in number, yet they as Gods, command all other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture-ſayings to bow down unto them, upon what account ſoever they are ſpoken, whether ſpiritual or natural, to continue for a time, or for eternity.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Therefore ſeeing all privative Scriptures are of none effect, but
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:103084:23"/>in reference unto thoſe which are poſitive, are not thoſe ſeeming wiſe men ſpiritually dark as pitch, which exalt the privative Scriptures above the poſitive, becauſe of the number of them?</p>
               <p n="6">6 My beloved brethren, you may know the privative Scriptures can have no being without the poſitive; but it ſeemeth poſſible that the poſitive might have been without the privative, as the glorious Creator was eternally alone, before any creaturely beings appeared in his ſight.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Again, all poſitive ſayings in Scriptures may be compared unto the inward motion of a Clock or Dyal; and all privative ſayings in Scriptures may be compared unto the outward wheel or hand, that alwayes motions from, or points to the inward cauſe of its outward motions.</p>
               <p n="8">8 My ſpiritual friends, if you diligently obſerve this golden rule, as ſure as the Lord liveth, and as ſure as you are living creatures, you ſhall finde it that ſpiritual Touch-ſtone, which will not onely diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver all vain-glorious opinions of literal or notional wiſe men, but it will alſo further you in the true underſtanding of the minde of God in the Scripture, above all men which are ignorant of this rule, or enemies to this advice.</p>
               <p n="9">9 For the ſtrengthning of the weak, in the next place I ſhall prove by many poſitive Scriptures, that the man Chriſt Jeſus glorified, is the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> onely, or is both Father, Son, and Spirit in one diſtinct perſon, God and Man bleſſed for ever and ever.</p>
               <p n="10">10 In the firſt of St. <hi>Johns</hi> Goſpel it is thus written: <hi>In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning was that Word, and that Word was with God, and that Word was God, and that Word was made fleſh, and dwelt among us, and we ſaw the glory thereof, as the onely begotten Son of the Father, full of grace and truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11 My brethren, though the one pure being hath variety of expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in holy Writ, to ſet forth the infinite glory of his divine Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, yet you may ſee in theſe very literal Records themſelves, that thoſe holy Names of <hi>Word,</hi> or <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>Father,</hi> be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>eth but one ſenſe onely.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Furthermore, this divine word <hi>God,</hi> or <hi>glorious Father,</hi> was m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>de, begotten, or changed into fleſh.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Again, you may by the true light of life in you, clearly ſee from the firſt words of the Text, that Chriſt and the Father were but one eſſential glory before they became fleſh: behold the one divinity
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:103084:24"/>in trinity of expreſſions onely: <hi>In the beginning was that Word, and that Word was with God, and that Word was God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 If that Word was God, that was in the beginning with God, and that God from everlaſting was that ſpiritual Word, Chriſt being that divine God, or God that divine Word, <hi>which in the beginning created heaven and earth,</hi> Gen. 1. <hi>and in the beginning or fulneſs of time became fleſh,</hi> then without controverſie he is the alone Everlaſting Father and Creator of both worlds, and the onely Redeemer of his choſen ones out of their natural darkneſs, into this myſterious light of a right underſtanding of one divine perſonal Majeſty, in variety of expreſſions onely.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Again, this poſitive Scripture in this firſt of <hi>John,</hi> doth open many other ſayings of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, as namely thoſe in the eight of <hi>John</hi> where it is thus written: <hi>And if I alſo judge, my judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is true, for I am not alone, but I and the Father that ſent me. Then ſaid Jeſus unto them, When ye have lift up the Son of man, then ſhall ye know that I am he, and that I do nothing of my ſelf, but as the Father hath taught me, ſo I ſpeak theſe things; for he that ſent me is with me, the Father hath not left me alone, becauſe I do always thoſe things that pleaſe him.</hi> Again it is written in the tenth of <hi>John, I and my Father are one.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="16">16 The next poſitive Scriptures bearing record unto the one perſonal divine being, is in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. the words are theſe: <hi>The firſt man is of the earth earthly, the ſecond man is the Lord from heaven.</hi> And in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. it is thus written: <hi>Of whom are the fathers, and of whom con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the fleſh, Chriſt came, who is God over all, bleſſed for ever, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> Again in 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. the laſt, it is thus written: <hi>And without controverſie great is the maſtery of godlineſs,</hi> which is, <hi>God is manifeſted in the fleſh, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="17">17 Again in <hi>John</hi> 14. it is thus written: <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, I have been ſo long time with you, and haſt thou not known me,</hi> Philip? <hi>he that hath ſeen me, hath ſeen my Father, how then ſayeſt thou, ſhew us the Father?</hi> And in <hi>Mark</hi> 4. are theſe words: <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto him, it is written again. thou ſhalt not tempt the Lord thy God.</hi> And in verſe 10. <hi>Then ſaid Jeſus unto him, Avoid Satan, for it is written thou ſhalt wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip the Lord thy God, and him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi> And in <hi>Mark</hi> 1. are theſe words: <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall be with childe, and ſhall bear a

               <argument>
                  <p>
                     <hi>1</hi> Of perſecution of Conſcience. <hi>2</hi> Of the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MY beloved brethren, by immediate inſpiration from that Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the next place I ſhall clearly demonſtrate unto the heirs of glory, the confuſed darkneſs of two or three ſorts of men, concerning the knowledge of the onely very true God, the which confuſion riſeth in them through their miſ-underſtanding of the true grounds of certain Scriptures, as namely theſe: <hi>God is a Spirit, and a Spirit hath not fleſh and bones as you ſee me have.</hi> But more eſpecially theſe Trinitary expreſſions, <hi>Baptizing them in the Name of the Father, and the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> Mat. 28.19. <hi>For there are three which bear record in Heaven, the Father, the Word, and the Holy Ghoſt, and theſe three are one,</hi> 1 John 5.7.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The firſt ſort of deceived perſons paſt or preſent, which affirm the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to conſiſt of three perſons, were <hi>Athanaſins, Socinus,</hi> alias <hi>Iohn Biddle,</hi> and their literal adherents.</p>
               <p n="3">3 My brethren, I do not ſay they can help this their darkneſs, or blame them for this their error; for alas, poor ſimple or over-wiſe men, to their imaginary underſtandings it is a pure truth, and thoſe which are contrary minded to them, in darkneſs.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Therefore who ever are left to perſecute their perſons for their judgements ſake onely, it would have been better for thoſe men that they had never been born, if they acknowledge a Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Take this for an infallible Rule, thoſe that perſecute a man for error in judgement concerning his God, will as ſoon perſecute him for the truth of Chriſt, as for a lie.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Let no perſecutor flatter himſelf, that he may repent and find mercy as well as <hi>Paul,</hi> becauſe <hi>Paul</hi> acknowledged no Jeſus at all, when he perſecuted his Saints; therefore you know how he pleads Gods mercy towards him, in that he did it ignorantly.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Moreover, how deeply did he pledge that cup of perſecution upon his own body for the Truths ſake all his dayes, which inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentally for Chriſts ſake he had cauſed others to drink?</p>
               <p n="8">8 Again, before I go forward concerning the point in hand, it will be neceſſary for me to ſhew you who thoſe perſecutors are, which commit that unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="9">9 My ſpiritual brethren, if a Turk do perſecute a man that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:103084:26"/>himſelf to be a Chriſtian, for deſpiſing of his <hi>Mahomet;</hi> or if a man called a Chriſtian ſhould perſecute an Infidel for deſpiſing the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, this perſecuting each other is pardonable, though not juſtifiable in their conſciences, when they ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the truth of leaving all vengeance in ſpiritual things unto God himſelf:</p>
               <p n="10">10 But on the contrary, ſuppoſe two men ſhall acknowledge that the man Chriſt Jeſus glorified, is the Son of God ſpoken of in the Scriptures, both of them affirming that all their hopes of eternal ſalvation onely depends upon him; if theſe men for difference in judgement onely concerning this Jeſus, ſhall perſecute each other before a Magiſtrate, or the like, there remains no more ſacrifice for that ſin;</p>
               <p n="11">11 For that is the unpardonable ſin againſt the Holy Spirit, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they perſecuted each other for his ſake which they both con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be their God and Savior, even to their own knowledge.</p>
               <p n="12">12 And in ſo doing they condemned their own faith, and to the utmoſt of their power they crucified the Lord of glory afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame, even before his filthy ſcoffing enemies.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Again, if a man ſhall come in the holy Name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall declare many heavenly ſecrets which he hath received from the throne of glory:</p>
               <p n="14">14 If men which confeſs the ſame Jeſus, becauſe the things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared are contrary to their ways, and hard ſayings to their compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, ſhall therefore condemn them as deluſions and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the ſpirit which ſpake them to be of the devil, in ſo doing they have fallen under that ſin of eternal condemnation, becauſe, as aforeſaid, they have crucified the Lord of Glory afreſh, and put him to an open ſhame, and have judged themſelves unworthy of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and have denied their own faith and hopes in him, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row their deſpiſing that holy ſpirit which ſeals men up unto the day of redemption.</p>
               <p n="15">15 My beloved brethren, though any one beloved <hi>Dalilah</hi> reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in men unto the death, tendeth to eternal condemnation, yet there are no actual ſins whatſoever but are pardonable, unleſs men commit them upon the account aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="16">16 My ſpiritual brethren, there is a vaſt difference between the heirs of glory, and the veſſels of ſhame concerning this ſin.</p>
               <p n="17">17 The holy ſpirit of Chriſt Jeſus hath endued his elect with ſuch
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:103084:26"/>a meaſure of light, though moſt of them know it not, that by vertue of that holy fire they are not onely preſerved from that condemning evil, but are rather fearful they have or ſhall commit it.</p>
               <p n="18">18 But on the contrary, the deſperate reprobate is ſo far from any kinde of fear in him concerning the committing of that caſt-away ſin, that when occaſion is offered, he glorieth in it as the acceptable ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice unto his God, and yet knows it not.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Thus briefly I have touched upon the unpardonable ſin againſt the holy ſpirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe very ſaying onely makes a ſin pardonable or unpardonable, becauſe he is Truth it ſelf, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly lie: <hi>Verily I ſay unto you, all ſins ſhall be forgiven unto the children of men, and blaſphemies wherewith they blaſpheme; but he that blaſphemeth againſt the Holy Ghoſt ſhall never have forgiveneſs, but is culpable of eternal damnation, becauſe they ſaid he had an unclean ſpirit,</hi> Mark 3.28, 29, 30.

               <p n="2">2 My beloved ſpiritual brethren, if the divine Majeſty ſhould contain of three diſtict perſons in coequal God-head glory, and each perſon be uncreated and eternal of it ſelf, then in ſtead of thoſe Names of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, they would of neceſſity be three Fathers onely.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Becauſe you know, that if the perſon of a Son or Holy Ghoſt were created or begotten, or proceeded from a Father, then it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to all ſober ſenſe or reaſon, that the perſons of Son and Holy Ghoſt, ſhould either be co-equal with the Father, or eternal of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Moreover, if the perſons of Son and Holy Ghoſt proceeded from the Father, then they are but finite created glories, and in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree lower than the Father.</p>
               <pb n="44" facs="tcp:103084:27"/>
               <p n="5">5 You that are ſpiritual know, that that which received its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning from another, could not poſſibly be made equal with that which was eternal of it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Uncreated incomprehenſible infiniteneſs, was capable to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mute it ſelf into a lower condition for its own tranſcendent advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in the ſpirits of his elect, but it was utterly impoſſible for him to create infinite, incomprehenſible beings, to become coequal in God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head wiſdom, power, and glory, with himſelf.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Uncreated glory is ſo unutterably infinite, that it is uncapable to comprehend the height, length, breadth, or depth of its own eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal excellencies.</p>

               <p n="19">19 My ſpiritual brethren, if men ſo acute in the letter can attain to underſtand this one thing in Scripture Record, then thoſe ſayings of Chriſt, or Son, and ſuch like, will be no ſtumbling-block in their
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:103084:28"/>way concerning Chriſts Father. You know that the Lord Jehovah ſaith, <hi>Becauſe there was none greater than himſelf, he ſwore by himſelf,</hi> concerning ſomething that was in his minde to bring to paſs: the thing is this, that God of Glory that was compelled to ſwear by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the exaltation of his own greatneſs in men and angels, becauſe there was none beſide himſelf, therefore he glorifieth himſelf alone.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Again, becauſe none could humble or exalt him but himſelf, therefore he alone firſt exalts himſelf by an oath, that he might be the more admired at of all that know him; after that he abaſeth himſelf a little lower then his angelical creatures in reſpect of death, that by vertue of his infinite humility in fleſh, his glorious Godhead might in that perſonal manhood exalt it ſelf in a new and wonderful way, far above all Gods, heavens, angels, and men.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Wherefore concerning the Scripture ſaying, <hi>The Lord ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my Lord, ſit thou at my right hand until I make thine enemies thy footſtool,</hi> that is, the everlaſting Father ſpeaking to himſelf in a two-fold condition, or God the great Jehovah in the height of his glory exalting himſelf over all oppoſition in his creatures, in the loweſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a creature himſelf.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Again the Lord ſaith, <hi>He will ſet his King upon his holy hill of</hi> Sion: And God ſaith, <hi>O God, thy throne is from ever and ever, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oyl of gladneſs above thy fellows.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="23">23 My beloved brethren, is there any more then one God and King of Glory perpetually fitting in the midſt of the Throne of the higheſt heavens?</p>

               <p n="25">25 Is not this one God in his Throne above, and in his Throne beneath, Chriſt Jeſus our Lord?</p>
               <p n="26">26 If this be granted, which none can deny but filthy Atheiſts, over-wiſe Literaliſts, or very weak Saints, I would fain know from any man under what kinde of Trinity ſoever, who that God and King was, unto which God ſaid, <hi>I will ſet my King upon my holy hill of</hi> Sion. <hi>O God thy throne is for ever and ever?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27 If there be but one God and King of <hi>Sions</hi> glory alone, then there cannot be a God, and God or a King, and a King of eternal glory: If this be not good ſenſe, let me be reproved with better.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Again, hath God any other King to exalt upon <hi>Sions</hi> holy hill
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:103084:28"/>but himſelf, or to ſit on the right hand of all Majeſty, Wiſdom, Power and Glory, in the perſonal preſence of his mighty Angels, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> but himſelf?</p>
               <p n="29">29 Who then is that moſt high and mighty God and King of <hi>Sions</hi> glory, or that ſpiritual All in All, or that Alpha and Omega, or that Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, but our Lord Jeſus Chriſt in immortal glory it ſelf?</p>
               <p n="30">30 Thus you that have any true light of life eternal in you, may clearly ſee that the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael</hi> which ſwore by himſelf, to himſelf, for his own further exaltation, by the ſame rule he may change his glorious condition into fleſh, and having humbled him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to himſelf, he may cauſe his humanity to ſpeak, pray, or cry, unto his divinity within him, or unto his own ſpiritual charge committed unto his angels without him, for a further manifeſtation of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſearchable wiſdom, power, and incomprehenſible glory in ſhame and weakneſs, as well as in power and glory, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="31">31 Is any thing hard or impoſſible for an infinite Creator to do, when his glory moves him to do it?</p>
               <p n="32">32 Again, did not his infinite power, wiſdom, and glory more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly appear in the loweſt abaſing himſelf in the viſible ſight of elect men and angels? why then ſhould it ſeem ſtrange to any ſober wiſe man, that the everlaſting Father ſhould be clothed with fleſh and bone, as with a garment?</p>

<pb n="53" facs="tcp:103084:31"/>and a full reſolution by the power of the Lord to forſake them, and a deſire to love the Lord in hope of his mercy, or to praiſe him for his preſerving me under all paſt dangers, then immediately I am ſubject to the moſt firieſt temptations of all; therefore what hopes can there be for ſuch a one as I am?

               <p n="4">4 Notwithſtanding theſe and ſuch like hopeleſs expreſſions, yet if they finde a man that experimentally underſtands the ſadneſs of their condition, they are apt to deſire that man to intreat the Lord for them.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Again, what ever befalls them, they have this property abiding in them, that if you ſpeak of the Creator, you ſhall never hear them ſpeak evil of his moſt glorious perſon, nor endure to hear any one blaſpheme his holy Name; but on the contrary, in the very depth of their deſpairings, they will ſpeak honorably of the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and juſtifie him in all his proceedings towards them or any other of his creatures.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The truth is, this is that repentance or godly ſorrow in them, proceeding from the Holy Spirit, and that moſt acceptable ſpiritual ſacrifice that can be offered up unto him, if the wounded ſpirit did but know it.</p>
               <p n="7">7 An elect veſſel under fear of the wrath to come, hath this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in it alſo, that it is both ready and willing, if it be perſwaded that the Lord will ſpeak peace through the mouth of any man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man unto its poor ſoul, even to walk unto the ends of the earth, to hear the voice of the Lord in that creature.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Another true teſtimony in a choſen veſſel is this, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his preſent hopeleſneſs of mercy in reference to his former re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellions, yet his ſoul through the ſecret love of God by his own light in him, is not onely fearful of further temptation unto evil, but it doth alſo abhor all kinde of iniquity whatſoever, upon the account of its contrariety againſt the Divine Majeſty, and is full of longing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter perfection, whether it be through life or death.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Again, another infallible teſtimony of an experimental wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſpirit is this, if out of bitterneſs of ſpirit they open their ſorrows unto their ſuppoſed or real friends, they will oftentimes ſay theſe, or ſuch like words:</p>

               </p>
               <p n="6">6 Moreover, though men ſpeak like Oracles, and ſeemingly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be innocent as Doves, yet if they ſay there is no God but within this world onely; or if they confeſs a God upon the Throne of his Glory in another world, if they ſay he is three perſons in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal Godhead glory, or in degree one above another; or their Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are in one perſonal Majeſty, or any ſuch like confuſion concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the one perſonal being of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:</p>
               <p n="7">7 From his unerring ſpirit I declare, that none of theſe are the men that I account ſpiritual or rational grounded men, what ever
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:103084:33"/>good thoughts they have of themſelves, or one of another; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if there be any ſober rational man in the world, come let us reaſon together.</p>
               <p n="8">8 What though thou and this preſent Civil Powers, to your own thinking, and full reſolution of equal good to the three Nations, did engage together againſt the former Powers, as enemies to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good, and did purpoſe by Gods aſſiſtance to eſtabliſh ſuch a Government for the peoples good, that the like could not be paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel'd in the world; what ever you intended by Covenants or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements, I would fain know whether you are any more then crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures? And if you grant me that rational truth, then in the next place I would know whether any man hath ſufficient power in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to continue one minute in his reſolution, though never ſo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly engaged?</p>
               <p n="9">9 Again, if it ſhould be replyed, thus reaſoning: All Covenants made in the preſence of God, or between man and man, are of none effect; no, that doth not follow, for the Moral or Civil Law is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good in it ſelf, and was added for tranſgreſſors; but whoſoever hath the true love of God in him, that man hath no need of mans law to be his rule, but he is a law unto himſelf, and lives above all laws of mortal men, and yet is obedient to all laws.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Again, I declare from the God of all truth, that no rational wiſe man, unleſs God himſelf by infallible grounds had declared it to him, dares enter into Covenants or Vows, to make a people more happier then they are, by a ſword of ſteel.</p>
               <p n="11">11 I confeſs that Civil Laws are juſt and good in themſelves, and according to equity all men are alike liable to the Law: but this I would fain know from any ſober man in this world, if he were guilty of the Law in what kinde ſoever, whether he would not rather live then be put to death?</p>
               <p n="12">12 Or if he were troubled with guilt of innocent blood, and breach of oath with faithful friends, would he not ſay in his ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a place of power, What advantage will my life be unto the dead wronged by me, for want of power from above to have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it?</p>
               <p n="13">13 Or what profit would my blood be unto the living friends of him that is dead? my life cannot poſſibly yield any true peace to the living any more then the dead; therefore O let me live, that I may do what good I can, ſeeing what is paſt cannot poſſibly be recall'd.</p>
               <pb n="57" facs="tcp:103084:33"/>
               <p n="14">14 Again, if Magiſtrates act any unjuſt things in their places, is any man ſure that another Power ſhould act better? Do not men that ſeem to be very ſober, juſt, and wiſe, oftentimes ſecretly act moſt unjuſtly of all, when exalted into high places?</p>
               <p n="15">15 But ſome may ſay unto me, If we had had that we fought for, we ſhould have taken ſuch a courſe, that no unjuſt Magiſtrate ſhould have continued long in his place, without being called to an account.</p>
               <p n="16">16 To this I anſwer: Truly my friend, the heart of man is ſo deſperately wicked, and places of Authority ſo full of fleſhly ſnares, that men are apt to act unjuſtly, if they die for it at the years end.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Is there not a Law of death without mercy againſt murther, and was there almoſt ever murthers committed more then now? where then is the power in the Law to prevent it?</p>
               <p n="18">18 Is there not a Law of death alſo againſt thoſe which are taken in Adultery, or ſuch like uncleanneſſes, and is there not more A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery or ſuch like committed, then in former Ages, when there was no Law of putting men to death; where then is the power of the Law to prevent natural or unnatural luſts?</p>
               <p n="19">19 Is there not a Law of death againſt Robbing on the high-way, breaking up of houſes, and ſuch like, and was there in many ages ſuch houſe-breaking, and high-way robbing as now there is, even by many men of very good eſtates; where then is the power of the Law to make an unjuſt man to do that which is right unto his neighbor?</p>
               <p n="20">20 Again, as beforeſaid, the heart of man by nature is exceeding full of pride, envy, luſt, and ſuch like wickedneſs, that they are apt to commit it ſo much the more, if men ſpeak againſt it, or make laws to prevent it. If men think this ſtrange, or queſtion the truth of it, if they know their own heart, and that God that preſerves men from theſe evils, they would then know this to be as true as God is truth.</p>
               <p n="21">21 If it be ſo, ſome men may ſay, What need there then be any Law at all?</p>
               <p n="22">22 For a juſt man there is no need of any Law as aforeſaid, but for a godleſs; the moral Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and the Civil Law of Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates are very uſeful in ſeveral reſpects; <hi>for where there is no Law,</hi> as the Scripture ſaith, <hi>there is no Tranſgreſſion:</hi> but devils cloathed with fleſh, blood, and bone, do want a whip, and is there any ſo fit to ſcourge them withal, as their own Laws? wherefore the Laws of
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:103084:34"/>God and man are uſeful to convince and condemn the wicked, but not to convert them.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Again, you know the Civil Law is alſo uſeful to defend an upright man from the violence of a wicked man, it being inſtituted for that very end, that as beforeſaid, he may be juſtly condemned in his own conſcience by his own law, for acting cruelty upon him that was always ready to do him good.</p>
               <p n="24">24 Though I thus write in the true defence of the Civil Law, with the obedience due unto it, ſure I am that a merciful man, in ſtead of taking advantage of the law for the impriſoning, or the cutting off the moſt wickedeſt of men, if it be poſſible, he will rather overcome him by love. O that all the choſen of God knew but the power of Love, Patience, Mercy, or Forgiveneſs to men that are averſe unto all good!</p>
               <p n="25">25 If you which are offended with the Civil Magiſtrate did but anderſtand, what equal good ſoever was intended by your combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions together; or if your intended good of reſt and peace had been attained unto through your eſtabliſhing falſe Laws in a golden bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, by load-ſtone Magiſtrates of your own chooſing, in ſtead of ſuch a glorious happineſs as you have imagined as beforeſaid, through the deſperate wickedneſs of the men of this age, is it not more probable the quite contrary would have enſued?</p>
               <p n="26">26 I pray you what were the acts of the <hi>Sodomites</hi> when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came all Magiſtrates through an equal general eaſe, from a mighty fulneſs of bread, and ſuch like: if you have any ſpiritual faith in you to believe the Record, read the firſt chapter to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and there you may ſee the effects of this your natural wiſdom of general hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to the Creation, or Nations.</p>
               <p n="27">27 Again, becauſe of the endleſneſs of mans reaſoning againſt that innocent peace of Conſcience, and joy in the Holy Spirit full of glory, belonging unto all thoſe that are made obedient to this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Rule; therefore I ſhall write a little further concerning this needful point.</p>
               <p n="28">28 If this Golden Rule be general, and without obedience to it no man can enjoy true peace, ſome men may ſay unto me, Are the Magiſtrates excluded from obedience to it, becauſe they are Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>makers?</p>
               <p n="29">29 From the Holy Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to this I anſwer: It is impoſſible for any Civil Magiſtrate to be obedient to
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:103084:34"/>this Rule, becauſe you know then, that he could not execute juſtice upon any man upon what account ſoever.</p>
               <p n="30">30 Again, whether a Magiſtrate be a juſt or unjuſt perſon, yet you may know, that upon a civil account, he repreſents the perſon or place of the righteous Judge of quick and dead; wherefore accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his obedience or diſobedience unto his commands, he ſhall be rewarded in this world, or that to come; Therefore know, that ſince the God of glory clothed himſelf with fleſh and bone in the form of a man, to kill, or conſent to murther the Head Magiſtrate, it is as if thou hadſt murthered the King of Glory himſelf.</p>
               <p n="31">31 Though nothing comes to paſs by chance or fortune, but by the Providential Decree of the moſt High God, yet no man can be cleared in his Conſcience from the guilt of innocent blood all his days, if ſecretly or openly he ſhall conſent to kill the Ruler of the Nation, without an immediate command by voice of words from the God of heaven and earth.</p>
               <p n="32">32 Suppoſe the former Governors of theſe Nations were guilty of much innocent blood, and ruine of Families, by their <hi>Spiritual Courts</hi> ſo called, and through their imaginary wiſdom, <hi>Lucifer</hi>-like, ſate in the throne of God, commanding men to worſhip their inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, triumphing over all tender Conſciences which could not bow down to their Egyptian Calves; and yet what ſpiritual or ſober ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional man can blame thoſe men for their willful bloody-mindedneſs, ſeeing a blinde fiery zeal moved them to it, in reference to the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of their God?</p>
               <p n="33">33 If any of them through covetouſneſs of ſilver or honor amongſt earthly Princes, did onely pretend a Divine Worſhip, and through ſecret envy to thoſe which could not obey their commands, did ruine men to the utmoſt of their power, through thoſe Jeſuitical Councel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors who were Atheiſtical, can any ſober man imagine or think that thoſe men were not oftentimes convinced of hypocritical irrationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, beſides a ſecret fear of eternal vengeance, notwithſtanding all their fleſhly glory, through which they were ſtrengthned in their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, to flatter themſelves up with vain hope that there was no God at all; or if there was any God, to cheat themſelves with a conceit that it was irrational cruelty, for a man to think that the Creator could be ſo unmerciful, as to create men for eternal damnation, in reference to momentary infirmities which their frail natures could by no means prevent.</p>
               <pb n="60" facs="tcp:103084:35"/>
               <p n="34">34 Again, if thou which thus reaſoneſt didſt truly underſtand, that thou hadſt no power in thy ſelf to withſtand theſe natural evils be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, thou couldſt not poſſibly then commit them; but this is hid from thine eyes by the ſecret wiſdom of the moſt High God, that thou mighteſt clear his divine Juſtice, in reference to thy former cruelties, with everlaſting thoughts, that thou mighteſt have done otherwiſe when thou waſt in thy earthly pomp if thou wouldſt.</p>
               <p n="35">35 If the God of Glory ſhould neither recompence men in this life, nor in that to come, for all their wilful vain-glorious bloody cruelties, which they think they could prevent if they would, then indeed theſe ſeeming wiſe men may juſtly ſay, if there be a God, he is ſo far from any ſpiritual equity, that he falleth ſhort of all rational equity whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="36">36 Another infallible demonſtration of the truth of this writing, is this, that though many writings extant are more accute in form of words, yet throughout this Book thou ſhalt finde no point abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely contradicting it ſelf, nor one another.</p>
               <p n="37">37 Again, another teſtimony of the truth of this writing, is this, That it diſcovereth the vanity of all formal or irrational opinion in man concerning God, Worſhip, Angels, Devil, Sin, Heaven, or Hell.</p>
               <p n="38">38 By this infallible Rule alſo thou mayeſt know, that this Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle proceeded from a ſpirit infinitely above all kinde of reaſoning in man or Angels, becauſe it alloweth no man, upon what pretence ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to murther one another, or to ſit in Gods throne to cut off the Head Magiſtrate, or to rebel againſt him with a ſword of ſteel, or to ſpeak evil of him, or deſire evil unto him.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Moreover, though this Book was penn'd by the hand of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man, yet by this undeniable Argument thou mayeſt know it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from that Spirit that cannot be deceived; becauſe it denies all power in man or angel, as to be capable to act ſpiritual or natural good to one another, or to reſiſt ſpiritual or natural evil without a continued light proceeding from a ſpiritual body, too infinitely glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to be eſſentially united to heaven, earth, angels, or men, yet this wonderful God is now for everlaſting abiding in a body of fleſh and bone; therefore not a bone of him was ſuffered to be broken upon the tree, or corrupted in the grave, onely his Godhead natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Life was left in this world for an everlaſting Conſolation unto thoſe that ſhall attain to believe that it was the unvaluable Life<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blood

               <p n="28">28 In the 53. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> it is written, <hi>he poured out his ſoul unto death.</hi> Again it is written, <hi>that his ſoul was heavy unto death.</hi> Again it is written, <hi>that his ſoul was made an offering for ſin:</hi> Again in the firſt of <hi>Revel.</hi> it is written, <hi>I am he that was dead and am alive, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I live for evermore.</hi> Again it is written in <hi>St.</hi> John, <hi>I lay down my life of my ſelf, no man takes it from me: I have power to lay it down, and power to take it again: Chriſt therefore died, and roſe again, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vived, that he might be Lord both of the dead and the quick:</hi> In the ſecond of the <hi>Acts</hi> of the Apoſtles it is written, <hi>thou wilt not leave my ſoul in grave, nor ſuffer thy holy One to ſee corruption.</hi>

               <p n="29">29 Behold, is it not as clear as the light in theſe Scripture Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, that the pure ſoul of Chriſt himſelf died and was buried in the Grave for a moment? and doeſt thou think thy ſinful ſoul is immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal, and ſhall ſcape death?</p>
               <p n="30">30 Again, thou canſt not be ſo fortiſh as to think that the ſpirit of Chriſt was buried alive in the grave; neither canſt thou poſſibly

               <p n="31">31 Again, did that ſpotleſs ſoul that was uncapable of the leaſt motion of folly, enter into death, and doſt thou think that thy ſoul ſhall ſcape death, which naturally is become ſo full of folly, that it is utterly uncapable in it ſelf of all kinde of purity whatſoever?</p>
               <p n="32">32 If no ſinful man be capable of the in-dwelling of the Spirit of God, ſome men may ſay unto me, What is that ſpirit, light, or life of Chriſt, ſpoken of in the Scriptures, which all men are made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of, except they be reprobates?</p>
               <p n="33">33 From a divine gift of the Eternal Spirit, to this I anſwer: The elect of God being endued with the vertues, fruits, or effects of the moſt Holy Spirit, theſe heavenly graces or motions in the minde proceeding from the glorious Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the divine Titles of God himſelf, becauſe they are of the very ſame nature, operating the very ſame effects of immortal glory in the end of the world, as it did upon Chriſt himſelf.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Again, you know it is written in Scripture, <hi>The fruits of the Spirit is love, peace, gentleneſs, goodneſs, faith, long ſuffering brotherly kindneſs, and ſuch like, againſt which there is no Law.</hi> Alſo it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten. <hi>That men were made partakers of the divine nature, and that Chriſt did live in mens hearts by faith.</hi> And that Chriſt ſaid, <hi>He was the Vine, and his Apoſtles or Believers were the Branches, and his Father, or Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, was the Husbandman.</hi> Again it is written, <hi>Let the ſame minde be in you that was even in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> Likewiſe it is written, <hi>There were diverſity of gifts or operations of the Spirit of God in men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="35">35 My ſpiritual brethren which wait for a Crown that fadeth not away, if you compare Scriptures with Scriptures, you may ſee then that no ſinful mortal did, or poſſibly could poſſeſs the in-dwelling eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Spirit of God himſelf, but onely the in-ſhining motions, operations, voices, vertues, fruits, or effects of that moſt glorious Spirit.</p>
               <p n="36">36 Again it is written, <hi>That Chriſt is the Light that lighteth every man that cometh into the world;</hi> and why ſo?

               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:103084:38"/>
               <p n="37">37 Again, though it is ſaid, <hi>that Chriſt is the Light of the world, or that he giveth light unto every man that cometh into the world,</hi> yet it doth not therefore follow, that all men are partakers of the light of Chriſt in them, unto life eternal.</p>
               <p n="38">38 Furthermore, I confeſs there is ſo much light of Chriſt in the moſt wickedſt of men to convince them of ſin, but not to reſtrain them, or convert them from evil.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Again, there is a two-fold light of Chriſt in men: the one is literal, and the other is ſpiritual.</p>
               <p n="40">40 Now you that are truly enlightned from above, may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that there is naturally ſo much light of Chriſts Law written in every ſenſible mans ſpirit to convince him of good and evil, and to cauſe him oftentimes to confeſs the truth, and to wiſh that he could love it, or do it, or that he might die the death of the righteous, like unto <hi>Baalam:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="41">41 But though this legal light of Chriſt in men be never ſo great in meaſure, yet no man was ever capable by it to be made inwardly obedient unto the ſpirit of Chriſt our Lord Jeſus.</p>
               <p n="42">42 Therefore who ever thou art which ſayeſt, that all men have ſo much light in them as will make them happy if they will, thou knoweſt not as yet what it is to poſſeſs that ſpiritual new birth of true light unto life eternal.</p>
               <p n="43">43 That light of Chriſt which doth not onely convince a man of inward Rebellions, and convert him from the ruling power of them, may alſo be called by a two-fold name, either a created light, or a renewed light.</p>
               <p n="44">44 This light of Chriſt in man is that inviſible image of God, which doth not onely purifie the inward filthineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, but doth alſo in ſome meaſure preſent unto the underſtanding the certain truth of an eternal perſonal glory, or everlaſting ſhame of a life to come.</p>
               <p n="45">45 Again, you know it is written, <hi>that except a man be born again, he cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.</hi> Alſo it is written, <hi>From his fulneſs we all receive, and grace for grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="46">46 My ſpiritual brethren, if a mans underſtanding is not capable to comprehend any thing of the inviſible and viſible things of the Kingdom of Glory, except the eternal Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus convey a new and ſhining light into him, what then think you, will become of thoſe men which ſay, <hi>there is ſo much light of Chriſt planted in every

               </p>
               <p n="47">47 If all men which are begotten and brought forth by the ſpirits of ſinful parents, were naturally endued in the womb with ſuch a meaſure of the light of Chriſt in them, that will ſafely conduct them into the Kingdom of Glory if they will, what need then would there be of any new birth at all from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Or what man would want any further light from the Holy Spirit of the onely everliving God?</p>
               <p n="48">48 Again it is written, <hi>When Chriſt aſcended on high that he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men.</hi>

               <p n="51">51 Again, if the Lord Jeſus Chriſt alone is the light and life of men, and if all men that are ſaved muſt of neceſſity receive a new light unto their dark ſouls from his Divine Spirit, then without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie thoſe men as yet are utterly ignorant of the new and true birth of the ever-living Jeſus, which ſay every man hath ſo much light of Chriſt in them that is ſufficient to ſalvation, if they will.</p>
               <p n="52">52 Again, if every man have the ſpirit of Chriſt living in his conſcience, as many men vainly imagine, what then is become of the ſpiritual body, or that Jeſus that aſcended into the throne of his glory, in the viſible fight of men and angels?</p>
               <p n="53">53 Or what man hath any need of his ſpiritual gifts, or heavenly graces at all, if his Chriſt and he was conceived and born together from the womb of his mother?</p>
               <p n="54">54 When the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>For in him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the Godhead bodily, and from his fulneſs we all receive, and grace for grace,</hi> I would fain know from any man whatſoever, whether that God or Chriſt were in them when they ſpake or writ thoſe words.</p>
               <p n="55">55 Again, if that Godhead ſpirit of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord had been within them when they uttered thoſe ſpeeches, I ſuppoſe it had been more proper for them to have ſaid, For in us dwelleth all the

               <p n="57">57 If Chriſt or his Spirit were within men when they uttered thoſe words, all faith or hope in reference to eternal glory was vain, and of no effect: why? becauſe if men have their God or Chriſt within them onely, they are no more under the teachings of another ſpirit, but are as glorious already as ever they are like to be: But what ſaith the Scripture, <hi>If our hopes were in this life onely, we were of all men moſt miſerable.</hi> Again concerning theſe words, <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory: Or know ye not that the Spirit of Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="58">58 My beloved brethren, what need any man hope for glory, if he hath the Spirit of Glory reſting upon him already?</p>
               <p n="59">59 Again, I hope no man will ſay that he hath a Chriſt in him that hopes after glory, or ſtands in need of any glorification what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever: Well then, the minde of the Spirit of Chriſt in thoſe words was this; That except your underſtanding be enlightned from the eternal Spirit of a glorified Chriſt in that heavenly throne above the ſtars, ye are but reprobates.</p>

               <p n="12">12 Therefore you that are truly ſpiritual may know, that all that light, life, or glory, ſhining in the ſpirits of elect men or Angels, doth not proceed from a God or Chriſt within them, but from an eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſpirit of a God or a Chriſt without them, too tranſcendent glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to be poſſeſſed by Heaven, Earth, Angels, or men, as beforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Again, though the natural life of created beings, by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of the moſt high God, be continued by vertue of the inſhining light of the Sun, yet you may know that what ever joy the creatures are poſſeſt thereby, it doth neither adde nor diminiſh unto the glory of the Sun in the leaſt:</p>

               <p n="15">15 Again, whether creatures are poſſeſſed with joy or ſorrow, life or death, by an extraordinary light proceeding from the Sun, yet you may know, that according to his underſtanding he glories in himſelf equally, in reference unto what was effected by him; ſo likewiſe whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther creatures are poſſeſſed with ſpiritual joy or ſorrow, eternal life, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="15">15 If no created being is capable of the indwelling eſſence of the Spirit of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe of its incomprehenſible glory; but its own body onely, ſome men may ſay unto me, if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God be infinite, what perſon, place, or creatures can be exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of its inviſible preſence, from that light of life eternal?</p>
               <p n="16">16 To this I anſwer: There is a twofold inviſible preſence of God in all ſenſible or inſenſible beings, that have any light or vertue in them.</p>

               <p n="23">23 Though all light or life in men, or Angels, proceed from the natural or divine preſence of the one holy Spirit of God himſelf, yet if that eternal Spirit were eſſentially united unto thoſe creatures, it could not poſſibly then be infinite.</p>
               <p n="24">24 To be eſſentially dwelling within all living things, is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finiteneſs, but finitneſs: but, as beforeſaid, to be a glorious being in it ſelf, in the bigneſs of man, and eſſentially diſtinct from Heavens, Earth, Angels, and Men, and yet from ſo ſmall a compaſs, though at never ſo ſmall a diſtance, all created beings in heaven or in earth to be virtually filled with his divine, or natural preſence, in their meaſures, according to the pleaſure of his good will by a word ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in this is all infiniteneſs indeed.</p>

               <p n="28">28 Is it not rather an impriſoning of the everliving God, and robbing him wholly of his infinite glory, for any man to divide his moſt bleſſed Majeſty into diſtinct perſons, or to divide his God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head Spirit into all ſpirits of men, and Angels, leaving no throne or perſon for the divine glory to be in, but his created beings onely.</p>
               <p n="29">29 In ſtead of honoring that Spirit within the glorious perſon of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, doth not thoſe men that affirm the indwelling of that infinite ſpirit in the whole Creation, not onely ſhare the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine glory and Godhead titles of the eternal Spirit amongſt the ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creatures, but alſo wholly deny any other Creator, or eternal Spirit, within or without men, but periſhing nature onely, whatever they pretend to the contrary?</p>

               <p n="18">18 It is written, <hi>great is the myſtery of godlineſs, which is, God was manifeſted in the fleſh, juſtified in the ſpirit, ſeen of Angels, preached unto the Gentiles, believed on in the world received up to glory.</hi> Again it is written, <hi>who being in the form of God, thought it no rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery to be equal with God, but he made himſelf of no reputation, and took on him the form of a ſervant.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19 Is there any more then one God? and was not Chriſt the form of this inviſible God, before he became the perſon of a man? and did not that ſpiritual form of Chriſt Jeſus enter into the Virgins Womb, and became a pure natural form?</p>
               <p n="20">20 Moreover was not Chriſt and his Father onely one uncreated, heavenly perſon from all eternity?</p>
               <p n="21">21 Though I undoubtably affirm, that Chriſt Jeſus eternally was the divine form of the inviſible God, yet I would not have any man imagine, or think, that I go about to prove the Creator to be a body of fleſh, blood, and bone from eternity.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Neither would I willingly have any of the bleſſed of the Lord, to be ſo groſly ignorant, as to think, that the glorious Creator could poſſibly be a ſpiritual living ſubſtance, without a body or perſon.</p>
               <p n="23">23 If Chriſt Jeſus, and the Father from all eternity, were but one diſtinct perſon, ſome men may ſay unto me, What might the form of his uncreated Majeſty be before he became fleſh from the light of life eternal?</p>
               <p n="24">24 To this I anſwer: His divine form did not conſiſt of natural
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:103084:44"/>Earth, Air, Water, or Fire, in the leaſt; but is was a bright burning fiery glory of uncompounded purities, continually ſatisfying it ſelf with variety of divine excellencies:</p>
               <p n="25">25 Though the ſpiritual perſon of the Holy One of Iſrael, was from eternity ſo tranſcendently glorious, that no Elements could poſſibly contain him without being immediately conſumed to aſhes, yet he was abſolutely from the crown of his glorious head, to the ſoles of his divine feet, in form like unto the firſt man <hi>Adam.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26 You that poſſeſs the heavenly truth in you, may know the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine form of Jeſus Chriſt the everlaſting Father, was of ſo pure, thin, or light nature, that as beforeſaid, it was ſwifter then thought, clearer then Criſtal, infinitely more glorious then the Sun, purer then the pureſt gold, or any thing more precious:</p>
               <p n="27">27 So that when the eternal ſpirit moved him to enter into the Virgins Womb, it being ſwifter then thought, and its body being of its own nature, he was in her womb before ſhe was aware of it, onely by a wonderful change in her ſoul, ſhe felt him converting his Godhead glory into fleſh, blood and bone, according to his promiſe by the Angel <hi>Gabriel,</hi> this was that wonderful myſtery of God the everlaſting Father, which manifeſted himſelf in a body of fleſh, at which moſt men and women ſtumble and periſh.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Is any thing impoſſible for God to do, when his divine glory moves him to it?</p>
               <p n="29">29 Moreover, is not the infinite power, wiſdom, or glory of the everliving God, moſt of all ſeen by men, or Angels, in the loweſt abaſing himſelf?</p>
               <p n="30">30 Do not all men which confeſs a Creator, conclude, that his holy ſpirit is infinitely full of all divine qualifications whatſoever, and is the incomprehenſible Spirit of the Holy One of Iſrael, any thing at all without its glorious vertues?</p>
               <p n="31">31 Is it poſſible, think you, that this eternal ſpirit could be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of its heavenly glories, without a diſtinct body of its own, to enjoy them in? If this be truth, the which none can gainſay but ſenceleſs ſots, or ſimple ſaints, then with controverſie, Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and the Father was eternally but onely one ſpiritual body in form like a man.</p>
               <p n="32">32 Is there any created being, whether ſenſible or inſenſible, either in Heaven or in Earth, that poſſeſſeth any kind of ſpiritual or natural motion, heat, light, life, joy, or glory in the leaſt, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out

               <p n="33">33 Hath the moſt wiſe Creator ſo ordered every living being that all the joy they poſſeſs is in their own bodies, chiefly diſtinct from one another, and that each others joy is nothing at all to one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unleſs they be both ſenſible of the ſame.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Can any ſober man be ſo ſenſleſs, as to imagine or think, that the glorious Creator of all ſpiritual and natural order, can poſſibly be any thing at all, without a diſtinct body of its own, as abundantly beforeſaid?</p>

               <p n="36">36 This being known to be as true as truth it ſelf, can it poſſibly be that he that gave beings to all things, ſhould not be ſomething that is infinite alſo, or a diſtinct glorious body having variety of holy Names attributed to him, according to his divine nature, for the exaltation of his infinite Majeſtical Perſon above all Heavens, Angels, and men.</p>

               <p n="22">22 You know in Scripture a man is called ſoul, body, and ſpirit, though he be but one perſon.</p>

               <p n="2">2 You know that in Scripture Records as beforeſaid, a man is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by a threefold name of Soul, Body, and Spirit, as if he contained of three diſtinct eſſences, yet you know that in the originality of nature, he is but one diſtinct perſonal being:</p>

               <p n="4">4 If an earthly Monarch did not poſſeſs a diſtinct body, could there be aſcribed any honorable titles of Emperor, King, or ſuch like unto him at all?</p>
               <p n="5">5 If the eternal Majeſty were not a diſtinct perſon, what holy names could be attributed unto him in the leaſt?</p>
               <p n="6">6 Is it names, words, or titles, makes a King to be, or gives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to an Emperor, without a natural perſon?</p>
               <p n="7">7 Is it divine words, names, or titles, makes a God to be, or gives being to a Divine Majeſty without a ſpiritual perſon?</p>
               <p n="8">8 Yow know that all the honorable titles in this world, to be vain and of none effect, if there were not the perſon of a man to aſcribe them unto.</p>
               <p n="9">9 You may know, that all honorable titles concerning a divine Majeſty, would alſo be of none effect, if there were not a ſpiritual perſon to attribute them unto, or unleſs they were a ſignification
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:103084:47"/>of the divine nature and form of a ſomething that is infinite.</p>
               <p n="10">10 It is as clear as the pureſt light it ſelf unto you that are expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rimentally ſpiritual, that it is not names, words, or titles, proves God or Man to be any living beings at all, except they be diſtinct perſons, to manifeſt their honorable names, as proceeding from comprehenſible ſomethings, and not from incomprehenſible no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things.</p>
               <p n="11">11 If the God of Glory in Scripture Records ſhould be called not onely by three divine titles, but by threeſcore thouſand holy names, alſo yet all the men in this world, or Angels in that world to come, can never prove him to be an infinite ſpirit without a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; or prove him to be any more then onely one diſtinct glorious perſon alſo.</p>
               <p n="12">12 You heavenly ones may alſo know, that the divine Majeſty is called in Scripture Records by three divine titles, that as before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, that the moſt learned, prudent men in this world, might ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver attain to a right underſtanding of the very true God, and the ſpiritual myſteries of his everlaſting kingdom, by all their rational ſtudy in the Scripture Records, or any other ways: and that was the very cauſe that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt ſaid unto his own ſpiritual power, repreſented by Angelical <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias, I thank thee Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to babes and ſucklings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="13">13. Concerning that threefold title of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt, in ſtead of three perſons, as of long time by blinde guides have been imagined, doth it not rather ſtand to better ſence, that the word Father hath reference unto the Godhead Spirit, eternally united unto Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And that the word Son hath relation unto the glorious body of the everliving <hi>Emanuel,</hi> which is viſibly ſeen by elect Angels, <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 And that word Holy Ghoſt hath reference unto a divine word of light, life, or power, proceeding from the inviſible Father, through the glorious mouth of the viſible Son, into the inviſible ſpirits of elect mankind, to the inlightning of their dark underſtandings, and purifying of their fleſhly mindes.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Thus you which are truly enlightned from above, may clearly ſee what that threefold heavenly Record ſignifieth, of that onely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct perſonal Majeſty of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, God alone, bleſſed for ever and ever, Amen.</p>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:103084:48"/>
               <p n="17">17 It is alſo as clear to you that are ſpiritual as the light it ſelf, that the holy one of Iſrael could not poſſibly be three diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons or ſpirits in one Godhead being, or any ſuch like confuſed deities.</p>
               <p n="18">18 You know, that whereſoever the Scriptures exactly make mention of the Holy One of Iſrael, it attributes all honor, praiſe, and glory, unto him always in the fingular number, as unto one diſtinct perſonal Majeſty, or glorious being, and not in the plural number of three diſtinct perſons, or ſpirits in one body, as hath been long imagined, by deceivers of the whole Chriſtian world ſo called, which are in bondage to their confuſed God, and invented forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities.</p>
               <p n="19">19 You know that in the concluſion of many ſeveral things the Scriptures run in ſuch a line as this: <hi>to the onely wiſe God, or unto God onely wiſe, or though there be that are called many Gods, or many Lords, yet unto us there is but one God, or the holy one of Iſrael,</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="20">20 You know becauſe there is none above a King, or head Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate in his own kingdom, or equal with him upon an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary occaſion, he will ſwear by himſelf, or by the faith or word of a King.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Thus it was with that Holy One of Iſrael, becauſe there was none above him, or beſide him, or equal with him in Heaven or Earth, he ſwore by himſelf, concerning the tranſmutation of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created glory, and everlaſting ſpiritual Prieſthood, into a pure body of fleſh, blood, and bone.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Before the God of Glory was deſcended into the Virgins Womb, you know he had many holy names attributed unto him; wherefore you may alſo know, from all eternity he was a diſtinct divine perſon, and not an infinite formleſs ſpirit, as moſt men blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imagine.</p>

               <p>I Shall write a little of a threefold Record in that moſt pure natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral body of Chriſt, when he was on this earth, in relation unto the threefold record of his ſpiritual body, in the inviſible heavens before ſaid: in the 53. of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> it is written, <hi>He poured forth, or out his ſoul unto death:</hi> and in the 19, Chap. by S. <hi>John</hi> you may finde it thus written <hi>but one of the ſoldiers with a ſpear pierced his ſide, and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with came there blood and water:</hi> here you, that are ſpiritually diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, may clearly ſee a threefold Record of natural witneſſes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding from that bleſſed perſon of our onely God and Savior, at his voluntary death:</p>
               <p n="2">2 As namely, blood, water, and ſpirit, wherefore his moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul pouring forth it ſelf unto death, that was the witneſs of the death of the everlaſting Father in fleſh.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The iſſuing forth of the unvaluable blood, that was the witneſs of the death of the eternal Son in fleſh.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The flowing forth of the water that was the witneſs of the death of the erernal ſpirit in fleſh on earth.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Theſe ſayings are not onely hard, but intollerable to be born by curſed Oanaanites, which underſtand nothing truly of the power of an infinite Majeſty:</p>

               <p>SEeing all ſpiritual power and wiſdom in Heaven above, or in Earth beneath, is no where to be found, nor never was, but onely within the divine Ark or ſpiritual perſon of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt;</p>
               <p n="2">2 In the next place by his own light in ſome meaſure, I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate unto you that are capable, what is the meaning of thoſe three witneſſes of Water, Blood, and Spirit in Earth, which agree in one, unto which the foregoing words have relation of Father, Son, and Spirit, which are but one.</p>
               <p n="3">3 My ſpiritual brethren, are not thoſe three witneſſes in earth the commiſſionated meſſengers, which by voice or words, through the glorious mouth of God himſelf, were ſent forth unto an unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving bloody worldly minded people, for a witneſs unto them to this purpoſe at the unexpected dreadful day of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
               <p n="4">4 Doth not that water witneſs in earth ſignifie Moſes, and the true Prophets under the Law, in reference unto the holy name of God the everlaſting Father?</p>
               <p n="5">5 Doth not the witneſs of the blood in earth ſignifie Jeſus, and the choſen Apoſtles, in relation of that heavenly name of God the eternal Son?</p>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:103084:49"/>
               <p n="6">6 Doth not that witneſs of Holy Ghoſt in earth, ſignifie thoſe two witneſſes in the 11. of the Revelations?</p>
               <p n="7">7 As Water, Blood, and Spirit, mixt together, are in a ſweet harmony in the body of a man in perfect health, and through a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of either of them the body could not ſubſiſt:</p>
               <p n="8">8 So likewiſe it is with thoſe witneſſes of God in earth, called Spirit, Water, and Blood; for theſe three ſweetly unite bearing witneſs unto but one onely wiſe diſtinct perſonal God glorified.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Therefore they agree in one heavenly harmony, and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly be one without the other, not onely becauſe they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded from one glorious ſpirit, but alſo becauſe they three onely by the ſecret wiſdom of the Eternal Majeſty, were choſen to bear witneſs in earth before men and Angels, unto that threefold Record in Heaven of Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="10">10 But ſome men may ſay unto me, the Law and Goſpel being witneſſed unto by the Prophets and Apoſtles already, what need is there of this third witneſs of the ſpirit in earth, or what doth it bear Record unto?</p>
               <p n="11">11 From a divine gift, to this I anſwer: In many reſpects there is as much uſe of the witneſs of the ſpirit in this Atheiſtical age, as of the two former witneſſes of Water and Blood.</p>
               <p n="12">12 To fulfil the Scriptures which ſaith, <hi>heaven and earth ſhall paſs away, but his word ſhall not paſs away; or not one title of his word ſhall be unfulfilled.</hi>

               <p n="13">13 How ſhould Chriſt Jeſus the Lord of Glory be known to be the onely God of truth, if there were not at one time or another a third witneſs in earth to fulfil the Scripture, <hi>for there are three that bear witneſs in earth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 Another neceſſity of this third witneſs of the ſpirit is this, becauſe you may know that there hath not been above theſe thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years a commiſſionated meſſenger ſent forth by the eternal Spirit, to bear witneſs unto that truth, which the two former wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes ſealed too with their bloods.</p>

               <p>IN the next place I ſhall write ſomewhat of mens empty opinions concerning the two witneſſes in the Revelation, for your better underſtanding of the inſuing truth, ſome men have imagined them to be the ſpirit of Chriſt, and the fleſh of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Now you may know that cannot be, becauſe the ſpirit and body of Chriſt were both glorified together in the higheſt Heavens, long before <hi>John</hi> propheſied of the two Witneſſes ſtanding before the God of the whole earth, amongſt the ſons of men.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Others there are that would have them to be the literal Law and Goſpel: now you that are ſpiritual may alſo know that cannot be the Witneſſes here ſpoken of, becauſe without a true Interpreter the Scripture in it ſelf, is but a killing letter.</p>
               <p n="4">4 You know that the inviſible truth of the Scriptures proceed onely from a true light received from the ſpiritual perſon of Chriſt Jeſus our Lord, in the throne of immortal glory.</p>
               <p n="5">5 You know that from the bare records, it is impoſſible to attain to the knowledge of the onely very true God, or the ſpiritual my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries of his everlaſting kingdom, and that was the very cauſe of theſe and ſuch like Scripture ſayings, <hi>I thank thee Father, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them to babes: Make the heart of this people fat, which have eyes and ſee not, cars and hear not, hearts and underſtand not:</hi> and why ſo? to fulfil the word of the Lord ſpoken through the mouthes of his Prophets in the time of the Law.</p>
               <p n="6">6 If the two Witneſſes here ſpoken of were the Letter of the Scripture, what need then would there be of the inviſible teachings of the Spirit?</p>
               <p n="7">7 For the moſt part, doth not the Miniſters and people ſet up the letter of the Scriptures, and offer divine worſhip unto them as the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> worſhipped their golden Calves?</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:103084:50"/>
               <p n="8">8 The two Witneſſes cannot be meant the literal Scriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is ſaid, <hi>If any man will hurt them, fire proceeds out of their mouthes, and devoureth their enemies: and if any hurt them, in this ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner they muſt be killed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 Now you may know, that at this very preſent there are many thouſands in theſe three Nations, that do not onely count the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures meer inventions of wiſe men, to keep the ſimple in aw under their Rulers, but if it were not for fear of men, if they could have their wills, they would burn all the Scriptures in the world to aſhes, and in ſtead of fearing any fiery vengeance following them, their unbelieving ſeared ſpirits would greatly rejoyce at it, as a moſt noble or profitable act to the whole world, for preventing all literal conte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtations concerning a God, or glory, or miſery to come.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Some men would imagine theſe Witneſſes to be the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and the Miniſters.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Now you may know that cannot be, becauſe both Magiſtrates and Miniſters are either choſen by one another, or by the voice of the people, in ſtead of being choſen by the voice of God himſelf, or a true Prophet ſent forth by his eternal ſpirit for that purpoſe.</p>
               <p n="12">12 'Tis written, <hi>that the witneſſes had a powerful gift of propheſie:</hi> now you know that ſince God became fleſh, inſtead of the Magiſtrates or Miniſters owning themſelves to be commiſſionated witneſſes, or Prophets of the divine Majeſty, for the moſt part, if men have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared upon that account, they have perſecuted them by impriſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſtripes, baniſhment, or death it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Again, it is written, <hi>the witneſſes were cloathed in ſackcloth,</hi> therefore they cannot be the Magiſtrates, or the Miniſters; becauſe you know that for the moſt part they are rather clothed in Satin, or other coſtly garments, then Sack-cloth or mean apparrel; Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing all Magiſtrates with their Miniſters are choſen by men onely through the ſecret decree of the moſt high God; and it being apparent that inſtead of honoring the Lord of life and glory, or ſhewing mercy unto his Prophets, for the moſt part they ſeek the honor of one another, and perſecute his meſſengers, and rejoyce in feaſting one another through the faſtings of others.</p>
               <p n="14">14 It is as clear as the light unto any man whoſe heart is not ſtone blind, that they are none of the witneſſes propheſied of by St. <hi>John</hi> in the eleventh of the <hi>Revelation.</hi>

               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:103084:51"/>
               <p n="14">14 Another ſort of Atheiſtical people there are, that would ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine themſelves to imply the two witneſſes there ſpoken of, ſaying the two witneſſes <hi>are within them, or every mens ſoul and body are thoſe two witneſſes,</hi> and ſuch like:</p>
               <p n="15">15 Now you may know that this is ſo far from any ſpiritual truth, that there is no ſence or reaſon in it: why? though a man be called ſoul, body, and ſpirit, yet he being but one perſon onely, you know he can be no more then one witneſs upon what account ſoever.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Again, the inviſible witneſs of mens conſciences, concerns mens own particular onely between God and man, or between man and man, and God onely wiſe perfectly ſeeth that witneſs always, and not men; therefore that cannot be the Witneſſes here ſpoken of, becauſe you know that the Witneſſes or Prophets of the Lord were always viſible whileſt they had a being in this world.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Thus it is as clear as the light, that none of all theſe are thoſe two witneſſes ſpoken of by St. <hi>John,</hi> but meet imaginary fancies of mens own brains, for want of a divine Light in them to diſtinguiſh between the true witneſſes, ſent forth by the Creator himſelf, and the falſe ones that went before they were ſent.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Again it is written, <hi>But I will give power unto my two Witneſſes, and they ſhall propheſie:</hi> My ſpiritual brethren, you may know that when <hi>John</hi> ſpake thoſe words, that the two Witneſſes were to come into the world, to bear teſtimony unto the truth of the two paſt wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of the Lord, becauſe the Text ſaith, <hi>but I will give power unto my two witneſſes, and they ſhall propheſie.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19 And you know, according to the truth of unerring Scriptures, the two former witneſſes had power given them from the Lord, and they did propheſie in their times:</p>
               <p n="20">20 So that you may underſtand, that the Lord did purpoſe to raiſe two men in this Atheiſtical Age, out of the very aſhes of the two former witneſſes, not onely for diſcovery of all lying appearances in his name, as they did in their times, but alſo for a more clearer manifeſtation of the deep things of God, then ever was ſince this world began.</p>
               <p n="21">21 You that are ſpiritual may know, that ſince the Lords two for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer witneſſes fell aſleep in the duſt of the earth, not a man have powerfully appeared to bear witneſs unto one diſtinct perſonal Creator, as they did, until we came forth in the latter end of the year 1651. in the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt by voice of words
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:103084:51"/>ſpoken unto me, by his eternal ſpirit three mornings together, to the hearing of the ear as a man ſpeaks to his friend.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Again, the Scriptures call them by the name of two witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes onely; wherefore if any man addeth to their number, or deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth them becauſe they appear not like a God, to bring fire down from heaven, or turn waters into blood, or ſuch like natural plagues, or miracles, as hath been acted already, if there be any truth in the Scriptures, can that man ſcape the Plagues of God in the life to come threatned in ſuch a call?</p>
               <p n="23">23 Again, you know it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord gave power unto the two witneſſes to propheſie:</hi> Is not this anſwerable unto the word of the Lord, when he ſaid unto me, <hi>that he had given me underſtanding above all the men in the world, and that he had choſen me as his laſt meſſenger for a great work unto this bloody unbelieving world, and had gived me</hi> Lodowick Mugleton <hi>to be my mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 You know that the witneſſes are ſaid to be <hi>two Olive Trees, and two Candleſticks, ſtanding before the God of the whole earth:</hi> my belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſpiritual brethren, hath not the glorious God of Heaven and Earth, both by ſpeaking and writing, manifeſted through our earthly Candleſticks, or mortal mouths, more divine Oyl, or golden Truth, then in any men in the world beſides?</p>
               <p n="25">25 Again, you know it is ſaid, <hi>the witneſſes were cloathed with ſack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloth:</hi> I humbly beſeech you that have truly taſted of the glory of eternity, did any men upon the face of the earth, ſince the time of the Apoſtles, upon an account as ſent forth from the eternal ſpirit, ſuffer perſecution for bearing witneſs unto the man Chriſt Jeſus glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, to be the onely wiſe God, and alone everlaſting Father, but we two onely?</p>

Chapter, the firſt words are theſe: <hi>then was given me a Reed like unto a Rod, and the Angel ſtood by ſaying; Riſe and meaſure the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that worſhip therein: But the Court which is without the Temple leave out, and meaſure it not, for it is given unto the Gentiles, and the holy City ſhall they tread under foot forty and two moneths.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 My devine friends, you may underſtand that that reed like unto a rod poſſeſſed by <hi>John,</hi> was a free gift of inſpiration which he received from a glorified Chriſt in the high heavens by his An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, whereby like unto a skillful Land-meaſurer, his underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing was enabled to comprehend the ſpiritual ſignification of the Temple of God, and the Altar, and them that worſhip therein.</p>
               <p n="22">22 You may alſo underſtand, that the Temple, and them that did worſhip therein, did ſignifie Gods ſpiritual houſe, or tabernacle of elect Jews, and Gentiles, which make but one compleat body for Chriſt Jeſus their head to raign in, by his heavenly light.</p>
               <p n="23">23 That Altar ſpoken of by <hi>John,</hi> did ſignifie the glorious body, or Tabernacle of the eternal ſpirit, unto which divine Altar, or Godhead perſon, thoſe ſpiritual worſhippers were vertually united by a received light from that infinite Majeſty: through which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible intercourſe ſometimes their ſouls were full of ſpiritual joy, through that inward ſeal of Godlike glory, which they were to enjoy in the life to come.</p>
               <p n="24">24 You may underſtand, that that unmeaſured Court without the Temple, did ſignifie the viſible Scriptures.</p>
               <p n="25">25 You know that when ſacrifices or ordinances were in force at <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> there was the inward Temple, and outward Porch or Court, joyning to the Temple.</p>
               <p n="26">26 You alſo know the Court without the Temple was a common place for all people to meet in, but none might enter into the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Temple in the time of their worſhip, but the chief Prieſts, or thoſe that were Confeſſors of the true God, and approved of by thoſe teachers of the Law.</p>
               <p n="27">27 Likewiſe you may underſtand, that the outward Court, or Scripture, which is common to all men that was left unmeaſured,

               <p n="28">28 Again, you know that the Court of the Temple was an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ornament or witneſs, unto the beauty or glory within the Temple:</p>
               <p n="29">29 So likewiſe the Court of the viſible Scriptures, is an ornament or teſtimony unto that eternal ſpirit of all truth, within the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, Body, or Tabernacle of the everliving God: and vertually in a great meaſure living in the Temples, or bodies of his elect, that are inabled to give a true diſtinction between the things of eternal life and eternal death.</p>
               <p n="30">30 Again, you know it is ſaid, <hi>that the unmeaſured Court with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Temple, was given to the Gentiles, and that they ſhould tread the holy City under foot two and forty moneths.</hi>

               <p n="31">31 You ſpiritual ones may know that the minde of the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in thoſe words was this: that to fulfil the Propheſie of Chriſt concerning the deſtruction of the Jews, their Temple and City of <hi>Hieruſalem</hi> by the <hi>Romans</hi> through conqueſt, they ſhould poſſeſs the literal Records, written by the Prophetical and Apoſtolical Jews, and not onely worſhip it in ſtead of the eternal ſpirit, but alſo by cruel perſecution for above thirteen hundred years, were to tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nize over the Holy City of ſpiritual Jews and Gentiles, that could not bow down unto their inventions.</p>

               <p n="33">33 From this papal power, whatever Apoſtical or Chriſtian ſtile they attribute to themſelves, through all the Chriſtian world ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, they have banded together as one man, to tread underfoot, as beforeſaid, that choſen City of heavenly minded Jews and Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Becauſe their innocent ſouls could not forſake that everliving Altar manifeſted unto them, and bow down to their Egyptians Calves, ſet up as a ſnare unto the people, chiefly for fleſhly gain and periſhing glory from men of their own ſpirits.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>TAke notice of this alſo, that in what ſoul ſoever this in-ſhining light hath appeared, though he be preſerved from deſpiſing a perſonal God, if before he taſte of death, he doth not attain to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this glorified Jeſus to be the onely wiſe very true God, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſight of ſo clear a diſcovery as this is, then this will be his por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, All the light at his death ſhall vaniſh and come to nothing, and in the day of the Lords account, by vertue of his decree, that Luciferian Serpentine ſpirit which abhorred the ſimple plain truth, becauſe it diſcovereth its carnal deceits, ſhall quicken and bring forth a body ſpiritually as dark as pitch, and naturally as heavy as lead, a body of thick darkneſs, or blackneſs of darkneſs, according to Holy Writ.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Again, it will be a body whoſe inviſible ſpirit ſhall be a fire of ſuch a dark envious nature, that it ſhall burn more intollerably fierce than any fire in this world whatſoever, through which it ſhall be tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, as if it were nothing elſe but a carcaſe or pillar of unſavory burning brimſtone.</p>
               <p n="3">3 In that very place where it doth appear upon this earth, it ſhall either ſtand, ſit, kneel, or lie along, neither ſeeing its own dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon, nor no mans elſe.</p>

               <p n="5">5 Again, all thy former pride, envy, covetouſneſs, lying, luſt, and hypocriſie, which thou with delight didſt act towards thy innocent brothers ruine, ſhall then be acted againſt thine own ſelf; it will be the eternity of thy condition that will increaſe thy ſorrowes and ſhame: O it will be in vain then to wiſh thou hadſt never bin born, or any thing elſe.</p>

               <p n="7">7 Is not this anſwerable to Chriſts own words, where he ſaith, <hi>If that light in thee be darkneſs, how great will that darkneſs be?</hi> Again, <hi>The Son of man ſhall ſend forth his Angels, and they gather out of his Kingdom all things that offend, and them that do iniquity, and ſhall caſt them into a furnace of ſire, there ſhall be weeping and gnaſhing of teeth,</hi> Mat. 13. Take notice of this record of Scripture, and you ſhall find that he ſaid, <hi>theſe things ſhould be done at the end of the world.</hi> Again, <hi>and when the Son of man cometh in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall he ſit on the throne of his Glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd ſeparateth the ſheep from the goats: and he ſhall ſet the ſheep on his right hand, and the goats on his left; then ſhall the King ſay to them on his right hand, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, take the inheritance of the Kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Then ſhall he ſay to them on the left hand, Depart from me ye curſed into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire, which is prepared for the devil and his angels,</hi> Mat. 25.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Here ye may ſee that the Lord Jeſus doth not ſpeak of curſing or burning up of ſin in all men, and eternal ſalvation unto all mens perſons, but maketh as clear a diſtinction as there is between ſheep and goats, of an eternal ſeparation of two diſtinct generations.</p>

               <p n="10">10 Again, what ever men ſhall imagine or think to the contrary, this was the very minde of Chriſt in thoſe words of his, concerning bleſſing elect Iſraelites to eternity, and curſing Canaanitiſh repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates for everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Who ſhall dare open his mouth in that day to ſay, why haſt thou made me thus? As ſure as the Lord liveth, and as certain as thou art a living ſoul and body, this very thing will come to paſs in a ſhort ſeaſon, though men or angels ſhould gainſay it.</p>
               <p n="12">12 The Lord Jeſus Chriſt neither can, nor will be found a liar in this nor any thing elſe, for all the curſed whimſies of men in this age, or any other age, though the perſons of ten hundred thouſand times ten Millions of men and women ſhould ſuffer the vengeance of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fiery death in utter darkneſs. O poor vain deſpiſer of a perſonal God, what acurſed condition art thou in, and knoweſt it not?</p>
               <p n="13">13 In the next place I ſhall ſpeak again concerning the Creators being an infinite perſonal Majeſty, unto which the viſible forms of men and angels bear record, as unto an incomprehenſible glory, from whence all their comprehenſible things had their beings.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Was there not an uncreated eternal Majeſty alone, when no creatures whether men or angels, appeared in a ſenſible living being?</p>
               <p n="15">15 Again, ſeeing there was from eternity a diſtinct Glory, is it not of neceſſity that this everliving being ſhould be a glorious ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing?</p>
               <p n="16">16 Is it not both lawful and expedient alſo for a man, according to ſobriety, to declare unto his ſpiritual and natural brethren, what this glorious God was, and is, that man being ſent forth by the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Spirit for that very end or purpoſe?</p>
               <p n="17">17 Doth not all men which confeſs a Creator, conclude poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly there is but one God, and no more?</p>
               <p n="18">18 If this one God was an infinite diſtinct ſpiritual ſubſtance, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any created being appeared to themſelves, is it not of an abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſity that he ſhould abide in his own divine center, and ſo continue a diſtinct glorious being to all eternity, for an everlaſting diſtinction between the unchangeable Creator, and the changeable creatures?</p>

               <p n="20">20 If there be a Creator, and if this glorious Creator be an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite diſtinct ſomething, too tranſcendently divine to be eſſentially united unto heavens, earth, angels, or men, which none can deny but conceited Notionaliſts, or literal Hypocrites, are not thoſe men as yet utterly ignorant of the Holy One of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which imagine the Creator to be an infinite formleſs Spirit, eſſentially united unto the whole Creation, utterly hating that God that is a diſtinct glorious being to himſelf?</p>
               <p n="21">21 Again, if the eternal Being be an infinite Spirit, can that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Spirit be any thing at all without it be endued with variety of divine qualifications?</p>
               <p n="22">22 Is not that infinite Spirit and its glorious properties, but onely one eſſence or Godhead ſubſtance?</p>
               <p n="23">23 Is not every vertue in the Eternal Spirit infinite?</p>
               <p n="24">24 Is that eternal Spirit and its heavenly vertues, any thing elſe but immortal Crowns of bright burning glories?</p>
               <p n="25">25 Can this infinite ſpiritual Glory be ſenſible of its divine ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies, or be a perfect bleſſedneſs, except he hath a diſtinct body ſutable unto his eternal Spirit, to enjoy his divine pleaſures to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and at his pleaſure to diſtribute by meaſure into the elect ſpirits of men and angels, the in-ſhining glimpſes of this incomprehenſible glory?</p>
               <p n="26">26 Though the eternal Spirit be that inviſible God, that by the power of its Almighty word hath created all things either for a time, or for eternity, into that glorious order they now appear to be, yet you that are ſpiritual may know, that without a body, face, or tongue, his glorious Spirit could not poſſibly have ſpoken any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct words at all, no more then the ſpirits of men or angels can ſpeak diſtinct words without a body, face, or tongue of their own.</p>
               <p n="27">27 Though all power, wiſdom, and glory proceeds onely from an inviſible eternal Spirit, yet you may know that it cannot be a perfect glory, except it be clothed with a Majeſtical perſon, as a viſible or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nament for men and angels, to behold face to face in the high hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, no more then the inviſible ſpirits of earthly Monarchs could

               <p n="28">28 Thus you that are truly ſpiritual, may know, that though there was nothing created by any bodily labor, or painful ſtudy of the glorious Creator,</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN the next place I ſhall treat again concerning the witneſſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to former intention: you may remember where I cea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, I challenged the whole world whether ſince the primitive times, any men upon the account of bearing record unto the man Chriſt Jeſus in glory to be the onely wiſe God, Creator, Redeemer, and everlaſting Father, appeared as the two <hi>Revelation</hi>-witneſſes?</p>
               <p n="2">2 Again until the Roman Biſhops perſecuting tyranny was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired in this land, you may know the two <hi>Revelation</hi>-witneſſes, or Prophets, never appeared:</p>
               <p n="3">3 For according unto Scripture order, you that are of a ſpiritual comprehenſion, may know, that we are thoſe two commiſſionated witneſſes, or Prophets of the Holy Spirit of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, becauſe as beforeſaid,</p>
               <p n="4">4 According to the propheſie by Saint <hi>John</hi> we exactly appeared when the Roman Biſhops times were expired, of treading under foot the holy City or people of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in this land.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Some men may object and ſay, <hi>Why are the witneſſes of the ſpirit

               <p n="6">6 Is it not moſt advantagious unto the Creators glory, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent men or Angels from knowing his witneſſes or their number, either by miracles or without miracles, until his pleaſure is to reveal them?</p>
               <p n="7">7 You know that Gods worſhip formerly was not onely inviſible but viſible alſo, and to continue for a long ſeaſon, therefore there required a great number of ſpiritual ſpeakers unto the elect.</p>
               <p n="8">8 But the worſhip of God being now onely ſpiritual or inviſible, thou mayeſt know, that a witneſs or two is ſufficient, the day of the Lord being near at hand to proclaim his glorious coming, by ſpeaking or writing unto the ends of the earth.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Again, is not a witneſs or two ſufficient to diſcover the vanity of all vain glorious fleſhly formalities amongſt the ſons of men, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord is at hand to make an eternal ſeparation between the bleſſed Iſraelites, and the curſed Canaanites?</p>
               <p n="9">9 Doth not theſe three witneſſes in earth onely agree in one di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine body of all truth in this reſpect, becauſe they received their commiſſion by voice of words, to the hearing of the viſible, as well as inviſible ear, through the glorious mouth of a perſonal Majeſty?</p>
               <p n="10">10 Wherefore can any man upon this earth that counts himſelf, or is accounted by others, to be a true Prophet, Apoſtle, Miniſter, Preacher, Teacher, Biſhop, Shepherd, Prieſt, Embaſſador, or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the God of Heaven and Earth without a voice of diſtinct words to the hearing of the ear from the everliving God?</p>
               <p n="11">11 Or can he poſſeſs any true joy or peace of conſcience, in his prophetical declarations, without ſuch an immediate commiſſion from the true God as beforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Again, though Spirit, Blood and Water, by the wiſdom of God ſweetly agree within the body of a healthful man, yet you know that they are of contrary natures to one another;</p>
               <p n="13">13 For the ſoul or ſpirit of man is an abſolute mortal fire within the blood and the water, which by vertue of its fiery nature, qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the blood and the water according to their capacities;</p>

               <p n="27">27 Alſo you know blood is too ſtrong for water, and fire too powerful for blood, ſo likewiſe you may know it is with the three commiſſionated witneſſes of God in earth, <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Apoſtles, and two laſt Witneſſes.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Though they unanimouſly agree in bearing record unto onely one diſtinct perſonal God of all ſaving truth, as ſpirit, water, and blood, ſweetly accord within the healthful body of a mortal man as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="29">29 Yet you may know that in their viſible worſhip they are at warfare with each other, until they have obtained victory one over another,</p>
               <p n="30">30 That the preſent immediate ſpiritual wiſdom of the divine Majeſty might bear rule in the conſciences of the choſen Jewels of immortal crowns, and not that which is paſt.</p>
               <p n="31">31 Wherefore when that Goſpel adminiſtration of blood appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, you know that the Apoſtolical Commiſſioners thereof did with all their power preach againſt all Moſaicall obſervations of Jewiſh circumciſion, new Moons, or abſtinence from meat, drinks, or any kinde of Sabbattical Ceremonies whatſoever, to be vain and of none effect, and contrary to the Spirit of Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="32">32 Thus you that are enlightned from on high, may ſee that that ſpiritual wine of the everlaſting Goſpel, in the choſen of God, tranſmuted all watery Ceremonies into its own ſpiritual ſubſtance, even as water being mingled with blood, is converted into its own nature.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Moreover, ſince the appearing of the two laſt Witneſſes of the eternal ſpirit, you may know, that all Apoſtolical ordinances imitated by men called Miniſters of the Goſpel, are counterfeit Apoſtles, which take upon them to Preach, Pray, Baptize with wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

               <p n="13">13 You may know that all things are poſſible and very eaſie for an infinite Spirit to bring to paſs, when his glory moves him to do it.</p>

               <p n="17">17 You know it is written, <hi>With thee is a well of Life, and in thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi> Here you ſee that <hi>David</hi> did not attribute the ſight of that light of the well of life unto his rational compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, but unto the divine light which he received from the well of life eternal:</p>

               <p n="26">26 Wherefore you know, in the forming of the man <hi>Adam</hi> it is recorded that God ſaid, <hi>Let us make man in our image,</hi> but you never read or heard that any other creatures were made in the image or likeneſs of God beſides them.</p>
               <p n="27">27 You know it is written, <hi>that Chriſt took not on him the nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abraham:</hi> why did not the Creator take on him the <hi>nature of Angels, but the ſeed of Abraham?</hi> you that are ſpiritual may know, it was becauſe the one was created or renewed into his own image or ſpiritual likeneſs, and the other was in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture quite contrary to the divine Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="28">28 If the angels ſpirits had been of the divine nature, how could it be ſaid, that Chriſt took not on him the angelical nature?</p>
               <p n="29">29 But it may be objected, that thoſe words were ſpoken in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Chriſts fleſhly part.

               <p n="30">30 Though the unchangeable glory of the Creator was wholly tranſmuted into a body of fleſh, blood and bone, that ſinful mortals might behold their God face to face and live;</p>
               <p n="31">31 Yet you may know that the nature of his ſpirit, in reſpect of its divine purity, neither was, nor poſſibly could be changed, but onely his infiniteneſs was laid down in fleſh for a ſeaſon, for the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of Scripture propheſies.</p>
               <p n="32">32 Again, if Chriſt took not on him that Angelical nature of pure reaſon, what then, think you, will become of all rational wiſe men, which underſtand nothing but what is viſible unto the eyes of ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal fleſh?</p>
               <p n="33">33 If the eternal ſpirit of the Creator hath no Angelical reaſon in his divine nature, ſome men may ſay unto me, How will you anſwer that Scripture, where the Creator ſaith unto the Jews, <hi>Come, let us reaſon together?</hi>

               <p n="34">34 As to that you may know, when that Scripture was ſpoken, that the Lord did not talk with the Nation of the Jews in his own perſon, but in the perſons of his true Prophets, which were ſent to convince thoſe ſtony-hearted Jews, by declaring the glorious God and his ſpiritual truths unto them, in the ballance of their own reaſon.</p>
               <p n="35">35 You know is it written that the Iſraelitiſh Jews cryed out, <hi>Let not God ſpeak to us any more leſt we die, and it was granted unto them, that he would not ſpeak unto them any more in his own perſon, as they deſired;</hi> therefore you may know, that the Lords reaſoning with the Jews was onely by his Prophets, which were rational men like unto themſelves.</p>
               <p n="36">36 If the Creator himſelf ſeemeth to reaſon with any man, is it any other wayes but to confound the wiſdom of unclean reaſon in man, by way of quere, and ſuch like, as Chriſt the onely God often did to the Jews in the days of his fleſh?</p>
               <p n="37">37 You know it is written, <hi>that Chriſt wept over Hieruſalem, and the Jewiſh Nation, ſaying, How often would I have gathered you toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not:</hi> behold, as he was a man he wept over the unbelief of their bloody<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> minded ſpirits, but as he was a God he rejoyced at their damnation, in relation unto his eternal decree.</p>
               <p n="38">38 Is not this anſwerable unto thoſe ſayings of his, where he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth them <hi>Serpents,</hi> and <hi>Generation of vipers,</hi> and <hi>children of the devil?</hi> and <hi>how ſhould ye ſcape the damnation of hell?</hi> and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Again, concerning thoſe words <hi>ye would not,</hi> you that are ſpiritual may know, that the divine will or pleaſure of God in his Prophets, did ſpiritually contend with the carnal ſpirits of the legal Jews, anſwerable to their curſed imagination, of having power in their own rational wills to do whatſoever he ſhould command them.</p>
               <p n="40">40 If the nature of the moſt pureſt reaſon be nothing but unſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory weakneſs, ſome men may ſay unto me, why then doth the Scriptures call them Chriſts mighty Angels? From the true light of life eternal, to this I anſwer by a compariſon, If men are choſen by the greateſt Monarch in the world for his ſociety, that they may be always ready to obey his will in whatſoever he ſhall command them, when they have received a commiſſion from his own mouth, to execute vengeance upon Rebels, their Towns, Cities, or Caſtles,
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:103084:64"/>in his dominions you know they appear mighty or dreadful unto all his people, as the King himſelf that ſent them;</p>
               <p n="41">41 So likewiſe you may know is is not in reference unto the purity of the Angels natures, that they are called mighty Angels; but becauſe they were created, not onely to ſtand in the perſonal preſence of an infinite Majeſty, to behold his bright burning glory face to face, but alſo to be ready to receive commiſſions from him to execute vengeance upon the Perſons, Goods, Towns, or Caſtles of Canaanitiſh Rebels, that are left to deſpiſe his ſpiritual government, or glorious truths, declared through the mouths of his choſen Meſſengers.</p>
               <p n="42">42 Again, though thoſe men that ſtand in the preſence of the worlds Monarch, are looked upon as the moſt mighty Nobles on this earth, yet you know that the ſight of them is not very dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to behold, until men know they have received a commiſſion of life and death from their mighty Lord and Maſter;</p>
               <p n="43">43 So likewiſe though the holy Angels are called mighty, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they ſtand in the perſonal preſence of the moſt infinite Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty of heaven and earth, yet you may know, that the ſight of them are not very dreadful to behold, until they have received a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of life and death from their moſt mighty Lord of heaven and earth.</p>
               <p n="44">44 Again, you know that the ſervants of the moſt eminent Prince, are not onely looked upon as honorable and mighty per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, becauſe they ſtand in the preſence of ſo powerful a Prince, but alſo becauſe they inherit a temporal kingdom of ſuch exceeding vaſtneſs, with variety of honor, beauty, riches, or pleaſures;</p>
               <p n="45">45 So likewiſe you may alſo know that the perſons of Angels, are not onely called Holy or Mighty, becauſe they ſtand in the viſible preſence of ſo infinite a Majeſty, but alſo becauſe they inherit a kingdom of ſuch infinite vaſtneſs, and unſpeakable fulneſs of all va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of raviſhing honors, beauties, riches, or pleaſures which are eternal.</p>
               <p n="46">46 Again, you know that the ſervants of an earthly Monarch, for the magnifying of their Lord and Maſter, in the ſpirit of his ſubjects, are cloathed not onely with or naments decked with ſilver, gold, precious ſtones, or the like, but their bodies alſo are anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with precious odorus, and fed with the fineſt delicacies;</p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 You that are ſpiritual may know in the creating of man, that the Lord God ſpake the word onely into the duſt of the earth, and immediately the vertue of that word brought forth a living man of pure fleſh, blood and bone, like unto God himſelf, as near as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly could be.</p>

               <p n="9">9 What were thoſe created vertues in <hi>Adams.</hi> ſoul? It was an inviſible ſpiritual light and life, called wiſdom, faith, love, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, meekneſs, patience, and ſuch like.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Though his ſoul could be nothing at all without its ſeveral properties, and though thoſe qualifications were all in a heavenly harmony, yet this I would have you to take notice of, that joy of ſoul that <hi>Adam</hi> did poſſeſs, aroſe in him from one divine voice onely, called the ſpirit of faith, which was all ſatisfaction in himſelf with his preſent condition, not having the leaſt thought of any hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs beyond what he enjoyed already.</p>

               <p n="12">12 If the nature of <hi>Adams</hi> ſoul had been rational in his creation, then through want of divine ſatisfaction in it ſelf, it would always have been deſiring after ſomething that he wanted, like unto the elect Angels and us, which have two contrary voices in one ſoul.</p>

               </p>
               <p n="3">3 For the manifeſtation of his infinite power and wiſdom, you know, that he can create light out of darkneſs, and life out of death, with a glorious advantage:</p>
               <p n="4">4 You know, that if the glorious Creator, for trial of his crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſhould leave the moſt experimental man that is to his own inſpired light, and ſuffer him to be tempted unto that evil of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery or Murder, and overcome thereby, he muſt of neceſſity looſe that former joy and peace of the divine light, or love of God in him;</p>

               <p n="6">6 Until the light of life appears again, with a new aſſurance of a glorious deliverance from that ſinful darkneſs and fearful death, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Truly, what ever men ſhall imagine to the contrary, as ſure as there is a God, this was the condition both of <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam</hi> alſo, when they were defiled with unlawful luſt one towards another, by ſubtil temptation of that Serpents councel, called the <hi>Tree of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 Again, though it is ſaid, <hi>It was a Tree to be deſired to make one wiſe;</hi> yet you may know that the ſoul of <hi>Eve</hi> was not of a deſiring nature after wiſdom in her creation, becauſe ſhe was all divine ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in her ſelf:</p>
               <p n="9">9 Therefore that deſire of taſting of the fruit of a Tree to make her wiſe as Gods, to know both good and evil, proceeded onely from the rational nature of the unſatisfied ſpirit of the Angelical Serpent.</p>

               <p n="11">11 And it was the ſeeming glory of his Angelical language that overtopped her preſent light, and begot that deſire in her under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, through which her ſoul was moved with a powerful deſire to make trial of his Serpentine councel, and to taſte of his ſpiritual meat ſo highly exalted by him:</p>
               <p n="12">12 Becauſe to her received new thoughts, ſhe had not heard ſo glorious a language before.</p>

               <p n="16">16 Alſo to know all that was to be known whether good or evil within her own ſoul; but the truth is, his ſecret intent was this, that when ſhe had taſted of that forbidden fruit, ſhe ſhould with him both know and feel in her own ſpirit the difference between <hi>light</hi> and <hi>darkneſs, life</hi> and <hi>death, love</hi> and <hi>envy, peace</hi> and <hi>war, good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> or <hi>God</hi> and <hi>devil.</hi>

               <p n="22">22 Truly in this caſe the Virgin <hi>Eves</hi> condition may fitly be compared unto the Virgin <hi>Mary;</hi>

<pb n="135" facs="tcp:103084:72"/>
                  <hi>Mary</hi> was honored with the onely wiſe Angelical God himſelf;</p>

               <p n="11">11 For our God is the God of all ſpiritual and natural order, and not of Magical confuſion.</p>

               <p n="14">14 Therefore they are afraid of appearing again in the bodies of men, leſt they ſhould reap the fruit of all their former filthineſs; <hi>Bleſſed are the purified ſpirits, for they ſhall ſee their God eternally face to face.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="15">15 Again, it is written, <hi>that ſhe gave alſo to her husband with her, and he did eat:</hi> that is, being full of natural luſt from that ſerpent within her, ſhe by her Angelical ſpeeches did intice her husband to lie with her, and ſo he was defiled alſo with her.</p>
               <p n="16">16 But it may be objected, that the woman was made for that very end for procreation of mankinde, therefore it ſeemeth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtrange that natural luſt ſhould be that ſin of eating the
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:103084:73"/>forbidden fruit, or tree of knowledge of good and evil.</p>
               <p n="17">17 To this I anſwer, 'Tis truth the woman was formed for that very end, and in her ſeed was the very law of generation:</p>
               <p n="18">18 But ſhe was defiled in ſpirit and body by another, to her own knowledge, before ſhe was capable to know what it was to deſire her own husband;</p>
               <p n="19">19 And the truth is, as aforeſaid, ſhe immediately deſired him to hide her known rebellion againſt her Creator.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Beſides all this, knowing her ſelf firſt in the tranſgreſſion, her conſcience told her that ſhe ought not to have enſnared her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent husband, to hide her folly;</p>
               <p n="21">21 But to have waited for the iſſue of her own doings, I mean the birth of that Serpentine curſed <hi>Cain</hi> in her womb, before ſhe had deſired the lawful knowledge of her own husband.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Again, if you that are ſober do but ſeriouſly ponder it in your ſpirits, you cannot be ſo weak as to think, that the law of eternal life and death depended upon the eating of an apple from a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral tree;</p>
               <p n="23">23 For you know that the Lord <hi>cauſed the earth to bring forth all variety of fruit to be eaten by the mouth,</hi> principally as a ſuperfluity of delight of the taſte of man onely:</p>
               <p n="24">24 Therefore how can ſober men imagine or think, that the ſouls and bodies of all mankinde ſhould be ſo venomed through the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an apple?</p>
               <p n="25">25 As ſure as the Lord liveth it was ſuch a deviliſh apple that was eaten by <hi>Eve,</hi> that it hath and will bring forth many Millions of Serpent Dragon Devils, in forms of men and women, unto eternal condemnation.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Again, you know it is written, that Chriſt ſaid unto his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, <hi>perceive ye not yet that whatſoever entreth into the mouth, goeth into the belly, and is caſt into the draught, but thoſe things which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed out of the mouth come from the heart, for out of the heart cometh evil thoughts, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, falſe teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, ſlanders, theſe are the things which defile the man,</hi> Mat. the 15.</p>
               <p n="27">27 My ſpiritual brethren, I hope ere this you ſee that it was not a natural apple eaten by <hi>Eves</hi> mouth, and ſo paſſing through her belly into the draught, that defiled her whole man.</p>
               <p n="28">28 For if our God and onely Savior be all truth, as he is, and cannot poſſibly lie, then <hi>that which is eaten by the mouth of man,
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:103084:74"/>goeth into his belly, and is caſt into the draught, without defiling his ſoul:</hi> ſo that without controverſie, that fruit or apple taken, and eaten, or received by <hi>Eve</hi> and <hi>Adam,</hi> through which they were wholy defiled, ſhamed, and fearfully tormented, never came into their mouths, or teeth, as literal wiſe men vainly imagine;</p>
               <p n="29">29 But as beforeſaid, it was a ſpiritual eating of the Serpent Angel in the innocent mouth of <hi>Eves</hi> ſoul, by her unlawful luſting after her innocent husband that knew nothing of the thing, that he might cover her iniquity, or when ſhe was called to an account, help to bear her burthen.</p>
               <p n="30">30 Again, it is written, <hi>the Kingdom of Heaven conſiſts not in meats and drinks;</hi> alſo it is written, <hi>whatſoever is ſold in the ſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles eat, making no queſtion for conſcience ſake.</hi> Furthermore it is written, <hi>there is nothing unclean in it ſelf, but as it is ſo eſteemed, for the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof;</hi> in theſe and many ſuch like Scripture ſayings, is it not as clear as the light it ſelf, that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever was made might freely be eaten, ſo that it were moderately taken?</p>
               <p n="31">31 So likewiſe whatſoever was created at the firſt for mans eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with his mouth, was abſolutely pure and very good for that end it was made; but of the contrary that fruit or tree of knowledge of good and evil eaten of by <hi>Eve,</hi> was not onely full of tormenting ſpiritual venom to her former peace of ſoul, but it cauſed her very body alſo to be ſubject unto all maner of mortal diſeaſes;</p>

               <p n="3">3 Again, <hi>if every green herb upon all the earth, and every tree where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is the fruit of a tree bearing ſeed,</hi> were given unto <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> for their food, according to what is here written, and that God that gave it them ſaw all that he had made to be very good, how then can any ſober man poſſibly imagine or think, that the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of good and evil could be of this creation, though it appeared unto <hi>Eve</hi> upon this earth, ſeeing all the trees that God had made in this earth, was very good in his ſight, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="4">4 This I would fain know from the Learned, whether this earth was capable of any curſe, or any natural thing that grew in it, before <hi>Eve</hi> had eaten of the forbidden fruit.</p>
               <p n="5">5 If the earth was bleſt, and all that was created in it, until <hi>Eve</hi> had rebelled againſt the Creator, then without controverſie what ever venemous creatures, trees, or herbs there are, or any thing elſe that is hurtful to the nature of man, upon the account of eating with the mouth, they had no being in this creation, until <hi>Eve</hi> had tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſed.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Therefore that Tree of Life in the midſt of the Garden, and the Tree of Knowledge of good and evil, could not poſſibly be trees bearing natural Apples, as hath been long imagined.</p>
               <p n="7">7 But they were trees of higher concernment, then of eating their fruit with the mouth, and caſting of it into the draught.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Do not all men that have any true light in them, look upon the tree of Life, from the beginning of <hi>Geneſis</hi> unto the end of the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> to be nothing elſe but the ſpiritual perſon of that Lord Jeſus Chriſt who is the onely ever-living God, from whence floweth all living waters into the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> who are the ſpiritual trees of eternal glory?</p>
               <p n="9">9 Do not thoſe men that are of a ſound judgement in the things of eternity, look upon that tree of Knowledge of good and evil, to be the out-caſt unclean perſon of that Serpent Dragon Devil, which through eſſential union with <hi>Eve</hi> become that murthering, lying cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed <hi>Cain,</hi> through which the ſpirits of the elect Iſraelites are all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed, as well as the Cananitiſh reprobate trees of eternal death,

               <p n="10">10 But alas, in this confuſed age of ſeeming lofty light, in ſtead of a true underſtanding of the ſpiritual trees of eternal life, and the carnal trees of eternal death, ſpoken of in Scripture-records, do not many Atheiſtical minded men in theſe our days, endeavor with all their might to convert the glorious truths of the everliving Jeſus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to nothing but brain fancies of notional lying vanities?</p>
               <p n="11">11 Is it not become a ſecond nature unto them for ſilver, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, to deceive their own ſouls, by flattering their poor deceived bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren lying under the power of many filthy luſts, that all their ſins ſhall be burnt up, but their ſouls ſhall be ſwallowed up into the eternal Being?</p>
               <p n="12">12 Suppoſe the forbidden fruit had been an natural Apple, the Creators nature being all purity it ſelf, and the ſoul of <hi>Eve</hi> being of his divine image, if the forbidden tree was pure in its nature alſo before it was touched by <hi>Eve,</hi> whence then came that ſin upon the ſpirit of <hi>Eve,</hi> ſeeing all things that was made in this creation was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good at the firſt, as is clearly proved by the Scripture Records already?</p>
               <p n="13">13 This I am ſure of, that no man that is ſober neither will, nor dares ſay, that that evil proceeded from the Creators forbidding her to touch the tree, or its fruit; neither could that ſin poſſibly proceed from the ſoul of <hi>Eve,</hi> becauſe it was of the divine nature in its creation.</p>
               <p n="14">14 And if that tree and its fruit eaten of by <hi>Eve</hi> were of this creation, how could there poſſibly be any evil in its nature, either ſeeing every thing and tree that was formed in this world, was made very good at the firſt in the pure eyes of the Creator, as abundantly beforeſaid?</p>
               <p n="15">15 But ſome men may ſay unto me, Though the eternal Spirit of the divine Majeſty was uncapable of the leaſt motion of evil, through the infinite purity of its ſpiritual nature, yet ſin being but a defect of nature, may it not originally riſe out of the ſoul of <hi>Eve</hi> though it was purely created, and for want of a Creators infinite pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in it ſelf for its own preſervation?</p>
               <p n="16">16 From the light of life eternal to this I anſwer: As for the originality of ſin, it is both granted and clearly demonſtrated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in that ſecret of the creation of Angels beforeſaid, that the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:103084:75"/>root of all evil ſprung from the nature of the unſatisfied Angelical reprobate, through the abſenting of the Creators inſpiring glorious excellencies to him:</p>
               <p n="17">17 But on the contrary, it is againſt all ſpiritual or rational truth that is ſober, that the leaſt motion of evil could poſſibly have its ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from the divine ſpirits of <hi>Eve</hi> or <hi>Adam;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 Therefore much leſs out of any kinde of Apple-tree, or any other woodden trees, herbs, or plants, which were made for mans natural comfort or delight onely;</p>
               <p n="19">19 For this I would have you to underſtand, though the ſouls of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> were but finite created beings, yet becauſe they were of the ſame nature of him that made them, their ſpirits were as free from all kinde of deſire after wiſdom or any thing elſe, as the Creator himſelf; for, as beforeſaid, where any deſire is, there is a want, and the leaſt want that is muſt needs be a defect or weakneſs in nature, which being not immediately ſatisfied, it is ſubject to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come nothing but evil.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Wherefore from a divine gift received from on high, I affirm againſt men or Angels, that that firſt deſire of ſin in the ſoul of <hi>Eve,</hi> proceeded not from the nature of her own ſpirit, but from the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean ſpirit of the unſatisfied Serpents language ſpoken into her.</p>
               <p n="21">21 For you that are ſpiritually quick may know, that there ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared no kinde of deſire or luſt in the ſoul of <hi>Eve</hi> towards <hi>Adam,</hi> until ſhe had taſted of the forbidden fruit; and if that fruit had been an Apple, is it not very ſtrange that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould be ignorant of it until his wife had found it out, ſeeing all the trees in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den which the Lord God had made, were very good, and given them for food.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Moreover, who ever thou art, after the peruſal of this truth, ſhalt call this <hi>non-ſenſe, blaſphemy, hereſie, lies,</hi> and ſuch like, becauſe it diſcovereth thy <hi>darkneſs,</hi> is it not a clear teſtimony in thy own conſcience, that thou art one of the curſed brood of the old Serpent Devil beforeſaid, which art not able to endure the light, becauſe by it <hi>thy deeds are manifeſted to be evil?</hi>

               <p n="3">3 Can you finde in any place of Scripture, that ever the Lord charged any evil ſpirit or devil with that deed done unto <hi>Eve,</hi> but that Serpent that ſpake unto her?</p>
               <p n="4">4 Therefore what ever men vainly dream of Apples pulled from woodden trees, or of a natural Serpent, or of an evil ſpirit in the body of an ignorant beaſt, or any ſuch like imaginary ſtuff concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the deceiving of <hi>Eve,</hi> yet you that are truly enlightned from on high may know, that that Serpent by whom <hi>Eve</hi> was beguiled, was that angelical reprobate caſt down from the Kingdom of Glory be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, into this periſhing world.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>WHat is the mind of the ſpirit by that word, <hi>eating of the tree of knowledge of good and evil?</hi> from the light of life eternal, to this I anſwer; The moſt wiſe Creator called it eating, for ſeveral reſpects:</p>
               <p n="2">2 Firſt you may be ſure, that the Lord God called it eating, that neither men or Angels ſhould know his ſecrets untill it was his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pleaſure, that he might receive the praiſe and glory alone from all thoſe that he ſhould reveal them unto.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The ſpirit of God called it eating, becauſe of the civility of that
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:103084:77"/>ſpeech; for the Scripture language is much like to a modeſt pure Virgin, who is loth to have her ſecret parts mentioned in the leaſt, though they are as uſefully in their kinde, and as honorable being undefiled as any part of the body;</p>
               <p n="4">4 And why are they honorable, becauſe the onely Lord of all life and glory hath honored them himſelf by his bleſſed birth.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Moreover you know, if a ſpiritual or natural thing be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded to the underſtanding of a man or woman, of which they have had no experience, their ſpirits feeds upon it, and conſiders the pleaſure of it as much as poſſible may be, before they conſent to taſte of it with the whole man:</p>
               <p n="6">6 So likewiſe in the word eating, you may know that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Spirit of God was this, that the ſoul of <hi>Eve</hi> ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware of harkning unto any other voice that was contrary unto that divine image, or voice of the Spirit of God within her, ſo that if ſhe ſhould hear the voice of a ſtranger, ſhe ſhould not give way in the leaſt unto that voice, leſt ſhe ſhould be overcome therewith.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Again, if the Spirit of God inſtead of ſaying unto <hi>Eve, thou ſhalt not eat thereof,</hi> ſhould have ſaid, <hi>thou ſhalt not ſpiritually, or na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, luſt after any God or Angel, but be content with what I have appointed for thee,</hi> then indeed there would have been no need of any interpretation upon the words, but as beforeſaid, the wiſdom of God ſaw it moſt fit to act otherwiſe.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Therefore what ever the learned men of this world dream of finding out the inviſible things of eternity, by ſearching into the Scripture Records, and comparing them together, the divine Majeſty hath locked up all the principal ſecrets of the Scriptures in his own ſpiritual breaſt, that he by any immediate inſpiration may diſpoſe of them into the ſpirits of elect men and Angels, moſt advantagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous for his own glory and their conſolation:</p>
               <p n="9">9 Therefore the ſacred Scriptures runs not in the line of reaſon, but in the line of faith, inſpiration or revelation, according to thoſe ſayings in the Hebrews and other Records;</p>
               <p n="10">10 By faith the divine work of creation, and wonderful miſtery of redemption, was, and is known with the immortal eternal glory, and everlaſting ſhame of mens perſons in the end of the world.</p>
               <p n="11">11 But of the contrary, you ſhall never read in any place of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, that any man knew the things of eternal glory in the leaſt, by any kinde of rational comprehenſion whatſoever.</p>
               <pb n="146" facs="tcp:103084:78"/>
               <p n="12">12 I confeſs the natural reaſon of man is a very good hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maid, if it be well qualified with the ſpiritual dame of divine faith, for illuſtrating of the things of God unto weak comprehenſions;</p>
               <p n="13">13 But as for truly underſtanding the inviſible things of God by the higheſt reaſon that ever was in man or Angel, it is utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, as abundantly beforeſaid:</p>
               <p n="14">14 Why? becauſe though the ſpirit of reaſon were never ſo pure, yet you may know its nature is but deſire onely after the knowledge of the divine nature of that ſpirit from whence it had its living being:</p>
               <p n="15">15 But of the contrary, ſpiritual truth or faith, being of the very divine nature of God himſelf, in what ſoul ſoever that heavenly ſeed is ſown, it ſpringeth up in that ſpirit with variety of glorious conſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, in reference unto life eternal, by vertue of an intercourſe with the eternal ſpirit from whence it came.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Moreover I confeſs, that a man that is endued with a <hi>Solomon</hi>-like gift of natural reaſon, may be able to comprehend all words, whether they are ſpoken in a good form, ſenſe, or language, or no, and to be mighty in diſputes about the glorious things of eternity.</p>
               <p n="17">17 But as for his real underſtanding whether there were any ſuch eternal things or no, he hath no certain knowledge of that at all, but his bare thoughts onely, which equally weighed in that bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance, it may be true, or it may be falſe, and all this is for want of an infalibility of truth it ſelf.</p>
               <p n="18">18 Therefore though the divine things of the eternal Majeſty be nothing elſe but ſpiritual purity of infallible truth in themſelves, yet unto that rational wiſe man, they are nothing but non-ſenſical blaſphemy, or lying tales, till his reaſon is confounded in him by a true and heavenly faith.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Again, if there ſhould be any evil Angels or Devils living in the air, and a Devil amongſt them called <hi>Belzebub,</hi> the Prince of Devils, what need any man trouble himſelf with the leaſt fear of eternal death, whatſoever wickedneſs is committed by him, becauſe if a man is tempted to evil by any Devil, but what is in his own nature onely, that evil ſpirit is to be eternally damned, and the man to be ſet free:</p>
               <p n="20">20 Nay moreover, if ſin or evil iſſued not from mans unclean reaſon, or lying imagination within him, is it poſſible think you, that any man ſhould be ſo tormented, as ſome men are, with an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:103084:78"/>burning through a ſecret fear of eternal ſufferings, riſing in them from the guilt of former evils, committed againſt the light of conſcience?</p>
               <p n="21">21 Furthermore, ſeeing all men which live after the fleſh muſt die or periſh, and that mans own luſt is that imaginary Devil, from whence proceeds all ſin or evil, without controverſie though men or Angels ſhould gain-ſay it, there are now no other evil Spirits, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, or Devils, but unmerciful men and women onely.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Again, if envy, pride, covetouſneſs, hypocriſie, luſt, and ſuch like, be the Devil in man, are not men and women thoſe Devils that are under the power of thoſe evils, I would fain know from the learned men of this world, whether there are any other evil Angels, or Devils, beſides mankinde, that luſt after women, or ſilver, or ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, or revenge, or any kinde of evil whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Truly if thoſe ſuppoſed wiſe men which talk ſo much <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſubtilty of the Prince of the air that rules in the children of diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, could poſſibly know that their own imaginary reaſon was that evil ſpirit, or Prince of all their airy diſputes concerning God, Angels, Devils, Heaven, Hell, eternal glory, or ſhame to come, which they know not of according to truth:</p>
               <p n="24">24 Then in ſtead of their rejoycing in the approbation of many men, in relation unto their natural gifts, their own ſpirits would im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately become the principle of all thoſe howling groaning Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent Devils, ſpoken of in holy Writ, even in the ſight of elect men and Angels in this mortal life.</p>
               <p n="25">25 Again, is it not againſt all ſpiritual or rational ſence, that any Man, Angel, or Devil, ſhould ſuffer eternal damnation for the ſins of another, or for anothers tempting him to ſin or evil?</p>
               <p n="26">26 Moreover, doth it not ſtand to very good ſence, that that creature that is left to himſelf to be tempted unto ſin or evil, and overcome thereby, and remains under the power of it to his lives end, ſhould eternally ſuffer at the great day for his own ſins, and not for anothers iniquity?</p>
               <p n="27">27 Wherefore is it not now one of the vaineſt things in the world for any man to think, that there is any other evil Spirit, Angel, or Devil, that tempts him to any motion, imagination, thought, deſire, word, or action of rebellion againſt God, or man, but that lying proud envious Devil, living in his whole man as beforeſaid?</p>
               <p n="28">28 Therefore let no man that profeſſeth ſpiritual light, or life in
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:103084:79"/>him, for very ſhame ſay, that God can be tempted, or tempt any man unto ſin, or evil, neither let him ſay, that any evil Spirit, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel, or Devil, in the air, or earth, or in the water, or in the fire, tempts him to commit any ſin or evil, but that air, watery, fiery, fleſhly Devil, dwelling onely in his own body;</p>
               <p n="29">29 I ſay, let him know that that is the Prince of the air, which through the abſcenting vertue of the Holy Spirit, begets thoſe le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions of Devils, or luſts, in the ſoul of man;</p>
               <p n="30">30 And it is the true light of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in all his new born ones that cruſhes thoſe Cockatrice Egs, before they become Serpent Devils, to ſting the whole man with fears of eternal death:</p>
               <p n="31">31 Thoſe Devils which by the powerful word of the Lord Jeſus were caſt out of <hi>Mary Magdelen,</hi> or any other creature, ſpoken of in holy Writ, were onely all maner of filthy diſeaſes, or fiery diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers in man, that hurried him about any deſperate wickedneſs what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever, oftentimes increaſing ſo powerfully, that it did not onely occaſion him to rend his own body, and break iron chains;</p>
               <p n="32">32 But alſo he is ready to tear any one in pieces, until the Lord of glory ſhine into his diſtempered ſoul with that golden grace of true faith, through which that imaginary Devil is chained up, whereby all his fleſhly goods were ſpoiled of ever having power in him as formerly, and being now in his right minde at the glorious feet of the true Jeſus, through his own pure light leading him into heavenly raptures, in reference unto his eternal glory at his viſible appearing in the Clouds with all his mighty Angels.</p>

                     <hi>1</hi> The prerogative power of God is above all Law. <hi>2</hi> Why God curſed the fallen An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel in the womb of Eve. <hi>3</hi> The Angels nature (after his offence) was not ſatisfied without being ruler.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>SOme men may ſay unto me, if it ſhould be granted that that Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent by whom <hi>Eve</hi> was beguiled, was none of the trees of this Creation, nor an evil ſpirit in the body of a natural Serpent, as hath been long imagined by the learned Miniſters of men, but was an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute Serpent Devil, as is abundantly declared by you, and that it entred into <hi>Eve,</hi> and in her womb, was pronounced curſed by the Creator, and ſo naturally brought forth himſelf a curſed <hi>Cain</hi> of her
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:103084:79"/>ſeed; what was this unto <hi>Eve,</hi> or why ſhould ſhe ſuffer any kinde of puniſhment for being overcome by an enemy that was too mighty for her?</p>
               <p n="2">2 From the light of life eternal, to this I anſwer: Concerning the enemy being too potent for her, that was hid from her eyes by the unſearchable wiſdom of the Creator;</p>
               <p n="3">3 For you that are ſpiritual may know, that the ſoul of <hi>Eve</hi> was not onely purely created in its kinde, like unto Angels, or other creatures, but it was alſo of the very ſame nature of his moſt glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſpirit that formed it, ſo that ſhe could not be ignorant in the leaſt, that all obedience was moſt due unto her Creators command.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Moreover, you may know alſo that the Creator, by the vertue of his Royal will for manifeſting of his glorious power, might give his creature a ſpiritual law of light and life in it ſelf, and yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve to himſelf the prerogative power of it.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Furthermore, you know the glorious Creator might preſent unto the view of his image, a Serpent Devil, for the trial of his workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and might upon pain of death forbid his creature of having to do with that tree, or of hearkening unto it in the leaſt.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Alſo you know the Creator might leave his divine image unto its own preſent ſtrength, through which it might by a ſubtile enemy be tempted and overcome to commit evil with it, againſt its Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors law, and yet its ſin be upon his own head;</p>
               <p n="7">7 Why? not onely becauſe it rebelled againſt its own divine light, but principally becauſe there was no law to binde an infinite Majeſty to protect it in its created purity.</p>
               <p n="8">8 My beloved moderate brethren, if men could forbear reaſoning againſt the Creators prerogative power, wonderful wiſdom, or ways which are paſt finding out, then would they enjoy true and laſting peace in their own ſouls, through deliverance from that conſcience condemning evil, of raſh judging things, they know not, but this grace of patience is prepared onely for the bleſſed Iſraelites, and not for ſcoffing Iſhmalites.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Again, if the Angelical Serpent was in the body of <hi>Eve</hi> when he received his curſe, ſome men may ſay unto me, was he capable of underſtanding of a ſentence denounced againſt him, being in the womb of <hi>Eve,</hi> and changed from his former condition, as abundantly declared by you?</p>
               <p n="10">10 Or why ſhould the Serpent and his generation undergo an
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:103084:80"/>eternal curſe, and <hi>Eve</hi> and her generation ſuffer but a temporal curſe? ſeeing ſhe rebelled againſt greater light then he;</p>
               <p n="11">11 Or if that Angelical Serpent was not curſed before <hi>Eve</hi> had actually rebelled with him, was not <hi>Eve</hi> as liable to an eternal curſe as he, ſeeing they both tranſgreſſed againſt an infinite glory?</p>
               <p n="12">12 From the light of life eternal, to this I anſwer; That curſe denounced by the Creator upon the Serpent in the womb of <hi>Eve,</hi> was not for his ſatisfaction in the leaſt, but is to convince <hi>Eves</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived thoughts of poſſeſſing ſuch god-like happineſs promiſed to her, if ſhe obeyed his councel, as aforeſaid;</p>
               <p n="13">13 Alſo it was to convince her in due time of that error of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting upon her firſt born, as a bleſſing received from the Lord, for when ſhe ſhould ſee the fruits of her heir, in ſtead of her rejoycing in him as at his birth, her ſoul would not onely loath his company, but would alſo caſt him out of her preſence, leſt he ſhould murder her, as he did his righteous brother, for her former love and tender compaſſion towards him.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Moreover, that curſe againſt the Angelical Serpent and his ſeed, was ſpoken unto her for her divine ſatisfaction afterwards, when the light of redemption ſhould ſhine in her deceived ſoul, and ſhew her that her firſt-born ſon was that Angelical Serpent, curſed in her womb by the Creator;</p>
               <p n="15">15 And that his generation of men and women were curſed in his loins alſo, that ſhe might the more abundantly magnifie the free grace of Gods electing love towards her deceived ſoul;</p>
               <p n="16">16 That having had ſo near a union and communion with that Angelical Reprobate, ſhe was not eternally curſed with him alſo.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Furthermore, notwithſtanding the ſoul of <hi>Eve</hi> rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a greater light then the Serpent did, yet you that are ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, may know, that ſhe was utterly uncapable of an eternal curſe upon her perſon for theſe conſiderations:</p>
               <p n="18">18 Firſt, becauſe her ſoul proceeded from the heavenly nature of the eternal Majeſty himſelf.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Secondly, becauſe that conſent unto evil in her, proceeded not from her own nature, but the unclean ſpirit of the Serpent ſpeaking into her innocent ſoul, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Again, you may know that the Serpent was called <hi>the tree of knowledge of good and evil,</hi> before <hi>Eve</hi> was tempted unto evil, therefore though he had been a tree in his firſt eſtate, which had
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:103084:80"/>known nothing but good, before <hi>Eve</hi> or <hi>Adam</hi> had any ſenſible be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet being fallen from his created purity, he was now become a tree of ſin or evil only:</p>
               <p n="21">21 Therefore he was a rejected, or curſed out-caſt tree from the glorious preſence of life eternal, before his viſible appearing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Eve;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22 So that though <hi>Eve</hi> through temptation was overcome to know both good and evil, with that curſed Serpent, yet ſhe had ſome relenting light of life in her after her rebellion, which occaſioned a ſecret ſhame and confuſion of ſoul in her, for her rebellion againſt the Creator.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Therefore ſhe was capable of being made a good tree again; yea, and a tree bringing forth fruit of a more tranſcendent glory then ſhe was capable of before her fall.</p>
               <p n="24">24 But of the contrary, that Serpent tree was ſo far from any kind of relentation of ſin, or rebellion againſt the Creator, before or after he tempted <hi>Eve,</hi> that in ſtead of being capable of reproof of ſin or evil, whereby he might be reſtored from his moſt wretched eſtate, he did utterly abhor both God and man, unleſs he might be their Counſellor, and ruler over them for everlaſting, as beforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="25">25 This eminent truth of the two Scripture ſeeds, or trees of eternal life and death, is plainly proved in the ſeventh Chapter of St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> where it was ſaid by Chriſt, the onely God himſelf, <hi>a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit, therefore by their fruits ye ſhall know them:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="26">26 So that you which are ſpiritual, may know, that according to the truth of Holy Writ, though men or Angels ſhould gain-ſay it, the Serpent Angelical tree being Reprobate unto all maner of evil, he and his ſeed of Cananitiſh men and women, were not onely curſed in the womb of <hi>Eve,</hi> but alſo before this world was.</p>
               <p n="27">27 But of the contrary, innocent <hi>Eve</hi> being a good tree in her Creation, through her proceeding from the divine nature of the tree of eternal glory it ſelf, though ſhe was overcome by that wicked one as beforeſaid, yet ſhe and <hi>Adam,</hi> or any of their ſeed, could not poſſibly eternally periſh, becauſe they were trees elected to bring forth good fruit unto everlaſting life and glory, long before this world was, as abundantly beforeſaid.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IF the Angelical Serpent was of as large a compaſs as the perſon of a man, ſome men may ſay unto me, how could he enter into the womb of <hi>Eve</hi> through ſo narrow a paſſage, as is declared by you? Truly this Quere is much like that in the 3. Chap. by St. <hi>John,</hi> where it ſaith, <hi>Can a man be born which is old, can he enter into his mothers womb again, and be born?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2 My ſpiritual friends, as our Lord anſwered <hi>Nicodemus</hi> unto his fleſhly queſtion, ſo likewiſe from his own light in like maner I ſhall make anſwer unto this, Though the body of the Angelical Serpent in its length or breadth was as a man is, yet you may know it was not of a groſſe ſubſtance as mans is;</p>
               <p n="3">3 But it was a ſpiritual body, created in another world;</p>
               <p n="4">4 For though the bodies of the mighty Angels are in forms like men, yet you may know that they ſhine like unto the Sun, or a flame of fire, being formed in a region of a more higher nature then this:</p>

               </p>
               <p n="17">17 Ye that are redeemed from the power of all inward filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, I beſeech you, what occaſioned the reſpection, or diſreſpecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Abel,</hi> in the pure eyes of the Creator?</p>
               <p n="18">18 Surely not their offerings, for you know that God needs no mans perſon for his ſacrifice ſake in the leaſt, but for the glory of his own name ſake onely;</p>
               <p n="19">19 Yet you know that <hi>Cain</hi> had as much wiſdom from his own reaſon to preſent an acceptable ſacrifice unto the Lord, as <hi>Abel;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20 Yet it was the Creators eternal free love unto <hi>Abel,</hi> which cauſed both his perſon and ſacrifice to finde ſuch ſweet acceptation with the Lord, that the divine love of God in <hi>Abel</hi> might be ſeen in the fatneſs of his ſacrifice;</p>
               <p n="21">21 In that you may know he was made to offer up himſelf a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſacrifice of inviſible and viſible obedience unto the Creator, as a ſeal of his being choſen to life eternal.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Yet you may know, it is not any kinde of ſacrifice, worſhip, righteouſneſs, or deſire in man, or Angel, that can poſſibly move the divine Majeſty to accept of it, or his perſon in the leaſt, but it is his eternal free love in his own ſeaſon, which operates in him all heavenly mindedneſs, or love to God, or man.</p>
               <p n="23">23 But of the contrary you may know, that the original cauſe of all maner of fearful darkneſs, and fiery ſhame in <hi>Cain,</hi> proceeded onely from the non-election of his perſon;</p>
               <p n="24">24 This was his condition when he was marked with the inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſeal, of rejecting both his perſon and ſacrifice, from thoſe words; <hi>Wherefore Cain was exceeding wrath, and his countenance fell down.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25 My beloved Chriſtian Friends, what moved <hi>Cain</hi> to be ſo full of wrath, or with whom was he ſo fiery hot?</p>
               <p n="26">26 Truly, as beforeſaid, his furious anger aroſe in him from a ſenſibleneſs of his out-caſt condition, and becauſe he could not
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:103084:85"/>come at the Creator himſelf, therefore his purpoſe was to avenge himſelf upon his favorite, even innocent <hi>Abel.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27 The Scripture gives you the reaſon thereof, becauſe his <hi>own works were evil, and his brothers good:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28 Thus you that are endued with that light that cannot be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, may ſee as clear as the light it ſelf, <hi>that it is not in him that willeth, not in him that runneth, but in God alone that ſheweth mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="29">29 What then think you in the day of the Lords vengeance will become of thoſe free-will-mongers, or oracle-grace Marchants, which curſedly teach their deceived fleſhly brethren, that a man may be in a condition of ſalvation to day, and to morrow be caſt away?</p>
               <p n="30">30 Truly my ſpiritual friends, if eternal election and rejection depend upon the acceptation of mans will, until he be born again with a diſtinguiſhing light from the divine will of the Creator, every man living would chooſe eternal death in ſtead of life, ſuch power, or purity, is in the choiſeſt of mens wills, wuntil the divine Majeſty preſent an immortal Crown of glory unto their blinde born ſpirits;</p>
               <p n="31">31 Then indeed, and not till then, mans ſoul that was averſe to all ſpiritual good, by that divine light is made willing to chooſe the better part;</p>
               <p n="32">32 Becauſe then he certainly knows that there is an eternal life and glory for ſome, and an everlaſting death and ſhame for others.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Therefore you that are truly ſpiritual, cannot but know, that though men ſpeak a language like unto Angels, or the divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty himſelf, as the Angelical Serpent ſeemed to do in the beguil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Eve,</hi> yet it is utterly impoſſibly they ſhould poſſeſs any true underſtanding of the ſpiritual things of the everliving Jehovah, or Jeſus, until their ſouls are firmly eſtabliſhed with an undoubtable aſſurance of their own perſonal glory in a world to come.</p>
               <p n="34">34 So much at preſent concerning the tree of knowledge of good and evil, or ſeed of the woman, and ſeed of the Serpent. O bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed and happy are thoſe men and women in themſelves already, that enjoy this diſtinguiſhing light of life eternal in the purity thereof.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>1</hi> Concerning Chriſts coming to judgement. <hi>2</hi> The vanity of that opinion that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves Chriſts perſonal raign upon this earth.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>BEcauſe of many opinions of Chriſt, and the ignorance of moſt men, concerning his coming to judge both the quick and dead, therefore in the next place I ſhall treat of this moſt needful point from certain ſayings of himſelf in the 17. Chapter of <hi>Matth.</hi> the words are theſe; <hi>for as the lightning that lightneth out of the one part under heaven, ſhineth unto the other part under heaven, ſo ſhall the Son of Man be in his day, and as it was in the days of Noah, ſo ſhall it be in the days of the Son of Man, they eat, they drink, they married wives, and gave in marriage, unto the day that Noah went into the Ark, and the flood came and deſtroyed them all; likewiſe alſo it was in the days of Lot, they eat, they drank, they bought, they ſold, they planted, they built, but in the day that Lot went out of Sodom it raigned fire and brimſtone from heaven, and deſtroyed them all;</hi> after theſe enſamples ſhall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</p>
               <p n="2">2 My beloved ſpiritual brethren, you know there is a twofold appearing of Chriſt unto the ſons of men, the one ſpiritual, and ſeen onely by the inviſible eye in the ſoul, and the other is perſonal, and ſeen onely by the viſible eye of the body.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Alſo you know Chriſt being the divine rock of all ages, he hath ſpiritually manifeſted himſelf unto his bleſſed <hi>Abels</hi> from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world, till now; but as for his viſible appearing in a body of fleſh, whereby men might be able to behold the face of their God in the ſimilitude of a man and live, you know that he did but once ſo appear onely for a few years.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Again, in the 25. Chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> it is written thus, <hi>And when the Son of Man cometh in his glory, and all the holy Angels with him, then ſhall he ſit upon the throne of his glory, and before him ſhall be gathered all nations, and he ſhall ſeparate them one from another, as a ſhepherd ſeparateth the ſheep from the goats.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5 It is alſo written in the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> thus, <hi>when the Lord Jeſus ſhall ſhew himſelf from heaven with his mighty Angels in flaming fire, rendring vengeance unto them that know not God, and that obey not the Goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:103084:86"/>
               <p n="6">6 If you that are ſpiritually ſober, do but compare theſe three places of Scriptures together, then you may clearly ſee, what Chriſt meant by that day of his perſonal appearing;</p>
               <p n="7">7 After his ſuffering and glorification he ſhall appear <hi>like light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning from one part under heaven to the other, he ſhall appear in his glory with all his holy Angels;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 Behold, ye bleſſed of the moſt high God, what kinde of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing of Chriſt in his glory like lightning, or a flame of fire, is this? is it not the viſible appearing of his fiery glorious perſon, with the glittering perſons of his mighty Angels under the whole heavens, or in the air?</p>
               <p n="9">9 If it be not ſo, how ſhall all nations be gathered together be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, that he may make an eternal ſeparation between them, according as he hath ſpoken?</p>
               <p n="10">10 It hath been long imagined by men of rare parts, in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of many people, that before the general judgement day, Chriſt would come again perſonally to raign a thouſand years on this earth with his Saints;</p>
               <p n="11">11 And their opinion is grounded partly upon the 20. Chapter of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> which was long ſince fulfilled, as I ſhall demonſtrate in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="12">12 But firſt I ſhall prove by Scripture Record, the failing off this opinion in the 3. Chap. of the <hi>Acts</hi> it is thus written, <hi>when the time of refreſhing ſhall come from the Lord, and he ſhall ſend Jeſus Christ, which before was preached unto you, whom the heaven muſt contain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the time that all things be fulfilled, which the Prophets have fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told ſince the beginning of the world;</hi> what think you then of Chriſts perſonal raign on this earth a thouſand years with his Saints? is it not point blank againſt the truth of this plain teſtimony of Holy Writ?</p>
               <p n="13">13 In the 14. Chapter by Saint <hi>John</hi> you may finde it thus writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten; <hi>Let not your heart be troubled, ye believe in God, believe alſo in me: in my fathers houſe are many dwelling-places, if it were not ſo, I would have told you, I go to prepare a place for you, and if I go to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare a place for you, I will come again, and receive you unto my ſelf, that where I am, there may ye be alſo.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="14">14 In this place of Scripture you ſee that Chriſt did not ſpeak in the leaſt to his Apoſtles of his coming again perſonally to raign upon this earth a thouſand years:</p>
               <pb n="164" facs="tcp:103084:87"/>
               <p n="15">15 But of the contrary, he told his heavy-hearted Diſciples that he was going to prepare a place for them, or he was going into the higheſt heavens, or prepared place of eternal glory, appointed for them with himſelf, after they had ſuffered with him on earth, and he would come again in his glory with his holy Angels, and receive them into his fathers houſe, or heavenly kingdom, where he now is, that they might with his mighty Angels <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly behold his bright burning glory, even face to face.</p>
               <p n="16">16 What is this perſonal raign of Chriſt with his Saints a thouſand years, that ſuppoſed wiſe men have ſo much talked of?</p>
               <p n="17">17 Is it any thing elſe but a temporal heaven at the beſt, if ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually examined?</p>
               <p n="18">18 Moreover, is it not a very unlikely matter that the infinite divinite Majeſty ſhould come again perſonally to remain upon this bloody earth a thouſand years with his Saints, having ſuffered here already, and aſcended upon the throne, or right hand of tranſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent glories, yea far above all heavens, as it is written, <hi>that he might fill all things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19 Furthermore, do not all perſonal raign-mongers confeſs, that Chriſt was God and man in one perſon, and that that moſt bleſſed body of his is now glorified in the higheſt heavens?</p>
               <p n="20">20 Do you not alſo pretend to believe, that the divine perſon of this God-man glorified, is infinite immortal, unchangeable, and eternal?</p>
               <p n="21">21 Moreover, if there be any ſuch divine light, or heavenly faith in your perſons, I would fain know whether you think it poſſibly that this mortal world, or men, can bear the preſence of a divine Majeſty, whoſe body is become a conſuming fire of immortal ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting burnings, without its being immediately conſumed to aſhes, or tranſmuted into his own glorious likeneſs?</p>
               <p n="22">22 O that all the elect did but know how ſuddenly this perſonal God will appear in his glory to conſume this whole world!</p>
               <p n="23">23 Again, if you look in the 11. Chapter of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> you may finde it thus written; <hi>All theſe died in faith, and received not the promiſes, but ſaw them afar off and believed them, and received them thankfully, and confeſſed that they were ſtrangers and pelgrims on the earth, for they that ſaw ſuch things, declare plainly that they ſeek a country; and if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out, they had leiſure to have returned, but now they deſire a
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:103084:87"/>better, that is an heavenly, wherefore God is not aſhamed of them to be called their God, for he hath prepared for them a city:</hi> here you may ſee that <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelf was ſo far from expecting a perſonal raign of Chriſt on this earth, though he believed that his ſeed ſhould en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the promiſes of God, both temporal and ſpiritual, in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed ſeaſons;</p>
               <p n="24">24 Therefore he onely minded a perſonal aſcending into the heavenly City of eternal glory, prepared for him and his elect ſeed, at the reſurrection of the juſt;</p>
               <p n="25">25 So that <hi>Abraham</hi> looked upon the promiſes of God, that they were to enjoy in this world onely, as types or ſhadows of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly City or Kingdom, with its raviſhing excellencies, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Moreover, if that glorious God of <hi>Abraham, Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> had intended a perſonal raign on this earth a thouſand years with his Saints, after his glorification in the higheſt heavens, can any ſober man be ſo weak as to think he would have hid it from <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom he was pleaſed to call the father of the faithful, and friend of God? You know what is written, <hi>ſhall I hide this thing from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="27">27 Furthermore, if the Lord in life, or death, had revealed any ſuch thing unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> the thing being of ſo great concernment, can you poſſibly think that he would have hid it from his generation to come? you may be ſure if there had been any ſuch thing to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed, he would have declared it to after ages.</p>
               <p n="28">28 Seeing neither <hi>Abraham,</hi> nor any of the Patriarks, or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, knew of Chriſts perſonal raign on this earth with his Saints, but ſpake as to the contrary altogether, what ſufficient ground hath any man in this world to expect ſuch a thing?</p>
               <p n="29">29 But how can it be otherwiſe, when men takes upon them to interpret the myſteries of the Scriptures, without an immediate Commiſſion from the eternal ſpirit.</p>
               <p n="30">30 Again, the Scripture ſaith, <hi>That the day of Chriſts appearing ſhall be like unto that of Noah and Lot, now you know in the day that Noah entred into the Ark, the flood came, and by degrees deſtroyed them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="31">31 <hi>Alſo in that day Lot departed out of Sodom it rained fire and brimſtone from heaven, and deſtroyed them all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="32">32 If the whole world was drowned with water immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Noah</hi> entred into the Ark; and <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah</hi> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:103084:88"/>by fire ſuddenly after <hi>Lot</hi> departed out of the City, and the day of Chriſts coming ſhall be in like maner, without controverſie in ſtead of his perſonal raign on this earth with his Saints, at his next appearing, immediately after all his bleſſed <hi>Noahs</hi> and <hi>Lots</hi> are aſcended into the Ark of his immortal glory, this firmamental created heaven and the lights thereof ſhall be all on fire;</p>
               <p n="33">33 And ſhall deſcend upon the face of the whole earth, and burn all the fruits and glory thereof unto aſhes, but it ſhall not be ſo favorable as to conſume the bloody minded men therein.</p>
               <p n="34">34 If the Lord of Glory had purpoſed to come perſonally to raign a thouſand years amongſt his Saints, before the general day of judgement, is any man ſo weak as to think he would have hid it from his choſen Apoſtles, whom he had promiſed to ſet upon twelve thrones, to judge the twelve Tribes of Iſrael, when he appeared a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain in his glory?</p>
               <p n="35">35 Is there any one place in Holy Writ that expreſly ſpeaketh of Chriſts perſonal raign in this world?</p>

               <p n="10">10 It is not thy natural, or all gorical whimſes, that can blinde the elect, nor pacifie the judge of life and death within thee, and without thee.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Again, there is a third ſort of deceived perſons, which with great confidence have declared, that Chriſt ſhould ſpiritually raign over the Nations in King <hi>Charles</hi> Seed; and of this ſort one <hi>Arice Evans</hi> in Black-Friers, was lookt upon as a great Prophet by many of the Royal party.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Moreover, from this their fooliſh conceit, they had many pritty whimſes, and dark ſentences, to blinde mens apprehenſions, like unto <hi>John Tanee</hi> and <hi>John Robbins;</hi> Which took much upon the ſpirits both of the ſubtile and ſimple alſo for a ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Furthermore, their underſtandings being utterly dark, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſpiritual or perſonal appearing of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his glory.</p>
               <p n="14">14 It is uſual for them concerning <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond, as to joyn Chriſt and him in one, calling him the white Pearl, that ſhould
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:103084:89"/>make the nations in a ſweet harmony of divine unity, through his glorious ruling over them; alſo they ſaid, that he ſhould not attain to the throne of his Father by any carnal weapons, but he ſhould be brought into this land, and ſet upon the Throne by an immediate power of the eternal Spirit of God himſelf.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Again, this carnal Cavalier Prophet pretended the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of certain Scriptures by voices or viſions, in reference to the raign of <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond; and <hi>John Tanee</hi>-like, ſought to confirm it by natural obſervations:</p>
               <p n="16">16 And truly, I do not blame the people that were deceived by them, becauſe they wanted a true diſtinction in themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweeen thoſe things which are divine and humane.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Moreover, when all pretended high Prieſts, Prophets, or Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles in this land, are clearly diſcovered by an unerring light of life eternal, I make no queſtion of the ſubtilty of their Serpentine ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to blinde their own eyes, and thoſe that were deceived by them.</p>
               <p n="18">18 I know they can ſay, <hi>If they be deceived, the Lord hath decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them;</hi> or they can ſay, <hi>We had a myſterious language given us by Jehovah to confound all literal or notional appearances in this confuſed age, and men underſtood us in a carnal ſence only;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="19">19 Or if they have often fixed a time concerning things that ſhould come to paſs, and nothing comes of it, they can alſo ſay, <hi>As the Prophet</hi> Jonas <hi>underſtood not the Lords time and minde, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the deſtruction of the Ninevites:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="20">20 So likewiſe this thing in the way of our fleſhly expectation, was hid from our eyes, but the mighty Jehovah in his ſeaſon, will bring it to paſs in a ſpiritual maner, beyond the comprehenſion of men or Angels.</p>
               <p n="21">21 Moreover, if none of theſe excuſes will blinde their eyes, which expected wonderful things from them, then becauſe they are not able to bear the ſhame of being found lyers in the name of the Lord, they will ſay, <hi>all men are lyars,</hi> or <hi>there is not a true Prophet upon the face of the earth;</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22 Or elſe they will ſay, <hi>There is but onely one pure being, inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ruling in the whole Creation, and this ſpiritual power manifeſteth it ſelf in various maners of ſeeming contradictions for the confounding of all mens underſtandings that would finde out its ſecrets;</hi> but in the end when it hath fooled men to the purpoſe, it will appear in a glorious harmony, to the content of all.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:103084:90"/>
               <p n="23">23 Furthermore for the blinding of their own eyes, and thoſe of their own ſpirits, that they may both fall together in a deep ditch of eternal deſtruction, they will, or may ſay, <hi>If there be a Creator, he is an incomprehenſible ſpirit, and all our ſpirits proceeded out of his ſpirit, and when our bodies dies, our ſpirits returns into his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit again.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="24">24 From this curſed error they may or will ſay, <hi>That God can as ſoon deſtroy himſelf, as any ſoul that he hath made, with an eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="25">25 Moreover, if this grand fleſhly deceit prove alſo but a broken Ciſtern, then as aforeſaid, they may, or will ſay, <hi>there is no God but nature onely;</hi> your moſt wiſe men in nature know this to be truth, but they are compelled to nominate a God to the people, to keep the rude multitude in obedience to their governours and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p n="26">26 Knowing if they ſhould confeſs a Creator beſides nature, all their pretended divine voices, or viſions, would appear but meer fleſhly lies.</p>
               <p n="27">27 Therefore for ſtrengthning themſelves in their Atheiſtical er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror to prevent diſcovery, they may, or will ſay, <hi>there is no world but this onely, and this world had never any beginning, nor will never have any ending, men may talk of a Creator, and a day of judgement for ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and honor, or to keep children or fools in awe, but wiſe men knows as aforeſaid, that one generation paſſeth away, and another cometh in its room, and ſo it will be for everlaſting.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="28">28 Thus you that are truly ſpiritual do, or may know, that the ſpirit of every man naturally, is ſo curſedly proud, that rather then men ſhould finde him a lyar in the name of the Lord of Hoſts, even againſt his own rational light, he is apt to ſay, <hi>there is no other God, or ſhame, or world to come,</hi> but the Elements of air, water, earth, and fire, of this periſhing world, though theſe and ſuch like ſandy foundations, are the pillars of curſed Cananites; yet I know that you bleſſed ones have not ſo learned Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="29">29 The fourth and laſt ſort of deceived men, are ſo far from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledging Chriſts perſonal raign with his Saints in any kinde whatſoever, that they blaſphemouſly affirm they are all Gods or Chriſts themſelves:</p>
               <p n="30">30 Theſe are thoſe, which ſay, that God is a Spirit, and that his Spirit, and their ſpirits, are but one ſpirit onely.</p>
               <pb n="171" facs="tcp:103084:90"/>
               <p n="31">31 Moreover, to ſtrongthen themſelves in this their Serpentine Sophiſtry, they can tell you from the Records, <hi>that Chriſt is the head of his Church, and his Saints are his body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="32">32 Alſo this ſort of men pretend ſuch a union with the divine Majeſty, that they do not onely attribute to themſelves his Holy Names or Titles, but <hi>Lucifer</hi>-like, they will tell the ſimple and fearful ſoul, that they are ſet down in the Throne of Glory with Chriſt already.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Furthermore, though this ſort of Saints in their own account are all Kings, Prieſts, and Prophets unto God, yet if you ſhould ask them a ſober queſtion concerning any ſpiritual thing after death, they are ſo dead drunk with their notional witchcrafts, that they count all men in darkneſs that ſee not themſelves in the throne of immortal glory already, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Again, they alſo ſeem to be full of Hymns, or Spiritual ſongs, in reference to the preſent glory they enjoy with the eternal Spirit, when the Lord knoweth they acknowledge no divine Majeſty, or God at all, but thoſe imaginary Siren ſongs, and their own natural blinde-born ſpirits, from whence they proceeded.</p>
               <p n="35">35 This ſort of ſeeming glorious Saints, do imagine their ſpirits ſo divine, that they think it impoſſible it ſhould ever ſee death, but they like unto children or fools, conceit their bodies turn to duſt for ever, but their ſouls aſcend into an unknown ſpiritual glory.</p>
               <p n="36">36 Therefore if a man ſpeaks of a perſonal God, or a perſonal glory in a life to come, they will tell him he troubles himſelf above a ſimple carnal God and Glory that is not;</p>
               <p n="37">37 But if he knew what it was to be poſſeſſed with divine light, life, or glory in his own ſoul, as they do, he would no more trouble himſelf in the leaſt, concerning a God or glory to come at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p n="38">38 There are ſome among theſe of a more purer ſort, which ſpeak many ſweet truths, and according to their light they live in them, onely poor hearts as yet they are ignorant of the fountain of glory, from whence their ſpiritual ſtreams proceed.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Moreover, though they cannot cloſe with a perſonal God, and perſonal glory of the elect in another durable world, and a perſonal ſhame of Reprobates in this world to all eternity, yet the ſecret love of God preſerves their merciful ſpirits from that error of the wicked, I mean from deſpiſing things that are hid from them.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:103084:91"/>
               <p n="40">40 Therefore I make no queſtion but in due ſeaſon, they ſhall be revealed to them unto their everlaſting joy and glory in the higheſt heavens, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="41">41 Furthermore, though theſe elect veſſels at preſent underſtand no other God but what is within them, yet they are afraid to call themſelves God, or Chriſt, or Creator, or the like, leſt there ſhould be a divine Majeſty to own thoſe titles himſelf.</p>
               <p n="42">42 Again, all thoſe ſimple hearted ſouls, which are appointed to eternal glory, are not ſo rivetted in their preſent light, but if a more clear manifeſtation appear, their ſpirits are both ready and willing to embrace it;</p>
               <p n="43">43 But of the contrary, all curſed Cananites are fully reſolved to remain where they are, though never ſo glorious a light ſhould appear.</p>
               <p n="44">44 Moreover, thoſe that are the bleſſed of the Lord, are very tender of condemning any men, of what appearance or opinion ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, if they ſee never ſo little of the pure light of life eternal ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing in them;</p>
               <p n="45">45 But of the contrary, the unmerciful reprobate condemns all men as in a bottomleſs pit that are contrary unto his fleſhly opinion</p>
               <p n="46">46 Furthermore, the bleſſed of the Lord are made willing to yield all ſpiritual obedience unto the unknown God, till they know him, and ſhew mercy unto all, though he periſh, this is a <hi>Job</hi>-like ſpirit, who ſaid, <hi>though thou kill me, yet will I truſt in thee:</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="47">47 But of the contrary, the hypocritical Cananites love to make a glittering ſhew before men, but as for any inward purity of ſpirit towards God, and mercy unto all men, they are ſo far from any ſuch principle, that they count it a deluſion in them that enjoy it.</p>
               <p n="48">48 Many of the bleſſed of the Lord do know, that all the deſires of men or Angels, cannot prevail with the divine Majeſty, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade him to ſet the ſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </argument>
               <p>IN the next place, according to promiſe, I ſhall write ſomewhat upon the 20. Chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> by St. <hi>John,</hi> becauſe that error of Chriſts perſonal reign a thouſand years with his Saints on this earth, is partly grounded from this Chapter.</p>
               <p n="2">2 My beloved brethren in the eternal truth, you know that this Book of the <hi>Apocalyps</hi> is too myſterious to be underſtood by the <hi>Achitophels</hi> of this periſhing world.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Alſo you know, that Gods way is to chooſe the baſe things of this world, to confound the moſt honorable things thereof, <hi>that no fleſh may glory in his preſence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Moreover you know, that if the moſt High endues a man with a divine gift, to demonſtrate his eternal ſecrets to his brethren, he preſerveth the ſoul of that man from giving the glory of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly power to his own net; my meaning is this, that man doth not give any praiſe or glory to any God, or Chriſt, or light within him, but he is made, as is due, to return all the honor, praiſe, or glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to an infinite Majeſty, or ſpiritual Fountain of glories without him, from whence alone all divine light as chryſtal ſtreams floweth into the ſpirits of elect men and angels.</p>
               <p n="5">5 But to come to the matter in hand, <hi>And I ſaw an Angel come down from heaven:</hi> Brethren, what Angel was that which <hi>John</hi> ſaw come down from heaven? Truly it was no other but that Angelical perſonal God, our Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf, with whom <hi>John</hi> was more converſant than all the Apoſtles in divine ſecrets.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:103084:92"/>
               <p n="6">6 Again, <hi>having the key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand,</hi> that is, this Angelical Jeſus alone had all divine power of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth in his own ſpirit, over the bottomleſs pit, lying imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations of devils incarnate, or curſed men.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Moreover, the everlaſting Goſpel, or Truth, which proceeded through his heavenly mouth for the conſolation of his Saints, and confounding of the Serpents, that was the great chain in his hand.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Furthermore it is written, <hi>And he took the Dragon that old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, which is the devil and Satan, and he bound him a thouſand years, and caſt him into a bottomleſs pit, and he ſhut him up, and ſealed the door upon him, that he ſhould deceive the people no more, till the thouſand years were fulfilled.</hi> My ſpiritual friends, what was that <hi>old Serpent Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon Devil</hi> which was bound a thouſand years by the ſpiritual power of Chriſt? It was an imaginary bottomleſs pit Devil within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of man, that perſecuted the Truth of Chriſt in his own perſon, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and Saints.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Again you that are ſpiritual may know, that the Serpent Devil that was bound or ſhut up as in a priſon, or in a dungeon of darkneſs for a thouſand years, was the curſed ſpirit of murdering <hi>Cain</hi> raging againſt Chriſt and his ſeed, in the perſon of King <hi>Herod</hi> and his ſeed, or ſeven ſons in the Ten perſecutions.</p>
               <p n="10">10 In the 12 Chapter of the <hi>Revelation</hi> it is thus written, <hi>And there appeared another wonder in heaven<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for behold a great red Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, having ſeven heads and ten horns, and ſeven Crowns upon his head.</hi> Alſo in the 13 Chapter it is thus written, <hi>And I ſaw a beaſt riſe out of the ſea, having ſeven heads and ten horns, and upon his horns were ten Crowns.</hi> This red Dragon and beaſt that roſe out of the ſea, was that <hi>Herod</hi> and his ſeven ſons in the Ten perſecutions, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Again, for your clearer underſtanding in the thing, give me leave to ſpeak of the three laſt verſes of this twelfth Chapter, the words are theſe, <hi>And the Serpent caſt out of his mouth water after the woman, like a flood, that he might cauſe her to be carried away of the flood.</hi> My ſpiritual friends, you may know that this Serpent was bloody <hi>Herod,</hi> and the woman was that Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> that brought forth the Lord of life, and the flood was the men of war that was ſent forth to perſecute the Virgin, and murder her Son and our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior: <hi>but the earth holp the woman, and the earth opened her mouth, and ſwallowed up the flood which the Dragon had caſt out of his mouth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="12">12 My ſpiritual friends, you may know that the innocent chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:103084:92"/>that were murdered by bloody <hi>Herods</hi> men of war, was that earth that opened her mouth and ſwallowed up that flood of perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution that was intended to be poured forth upon the bleſſed Babe, or God of eternal Glory.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Again, <hi>then the Dragon was wroth with the woman, and went and made war with the remnant of her ſeed, which keep the commandments of God, and have the teſtimony of Jeſus Chriſt.:</hi> My ſpiritual bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you may alſo know becauſe <hi>Herod</hi> could not come at the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Babe and his Mother in its infancy, therefore his curſed ſpirit in his ſeed or ſons, did perſecute the Lord of Glory, and his Apoſtles, and Believers, to the death afterwards; if you look with a ſpiritual eye in the ſecond of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the <hi>Acts,</hi> upon king <hi>Herod</hi> his ſeed, Councel of Prieſts, Scribes, and men of war, then you may ſee this to be the very minde of the holy Spirit in theſe myſterious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Again, when the earthly powers through the glorious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the everlaſting Goſpel are ſealed up unto bloody minded<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, againſt the meſſengers of that divine Truth, to fulfil the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret decree of the moſt high God, then are their ſpirits ſhut cloſe priſoners in their own bodies, as in a dungeon of ſpiritual darkneſs, through which, in ſtead of enjoying any ſweet peace, that ſoul is full of raging madneſs, and not knowing which way to turn it ſelf, it thinks to get out of its condition by acting all maner of cruelties to the utmoſt of its power.</p>
               <p n="15">15 My ſpiritual friends, you may know that this was that ſpiritual binding of that old Serpent Dragon Devil in king <hi>Herod,</hi> and his Herodian ſpirits, for a thouſand years; the which thouſand years were expired when the Ten perſecutions ceaſed, which was the ten horns of that ſavage beaſt, aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="16">16 For you that are ſpiritual know, that no man can poſſibly finde out the truth of Holy Writ of the moſt perfecteſt account in the world, becauſe the wiſdom of God hath reſerved the ſeaſons of all divine ſecrets in his own heavenly breaſt, that men or Angels may know them, when his Glory ſeeth it moſt fit.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Wherefore, all time obſervation in reference to a right un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding of any thing that is ſpiritual, is utterly confounded in that Scripture ſaying, <hi>For a thouſand years is as one day with the Lord, and a day is as a thouſand years.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="18">18 Moreover, when the glorious Truths of the divine Majeſty
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:103084:93"/>were poured forth upon the face of the Nations, as it was in the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, through the ſpiritual Miniſtery of the everliving God, you may know whileſt that commiſſionated ſpiritual power remained in being, the Nations could not be deceived with the hypocritical Formalities of the perſecuting Powers and Prieſts of this periſhing world.</p>
               <p n="19">19 This was that ſhutting up of the Serpent Dragon Devil in the evil powers aforeſaid, from deceiving the Nations any more until the thouſand years of their ten bloody perſecutions of the Saints was fulfilled.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Again it is written, <hi>And I ſaw ſeats, and they ſate upon them, and judgement was given unto them, and I ſaw the ſouls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which did not worſhip the beaſt, neither his image, neither had taken his mark upon their foreheads, and they lived and raigned with Chriſt a thouſand years:</hi> My ſpiritual friends, what judgement-ſeats were thoſe which <hi>John</hi> ſaw, and who were them that ſate thereon in judgement?</p>
               <p n="21">21 Thoſe ſeats of judgement were the accuſing conſciences of the bloody perſecutors aforeſaid; and the preaching or publiſhing of the glorious truths of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, through the Commiſſiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted mouthes of the choſen Apoſtles, Miniſters, or Saints, was that judge of life and death reigning in the conſciences of the aforeſaid ſpiritual Tyrants: <hi>Do ye not know that the Saints ſhall judge the world? Know ye not that we ſhall judge the Angels?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="22">22 My ſpiritual friends, what ever men ſhall imagine of theſe literal Records, as ſure as the Lord liveth, thoſe Angels ſpoken of by the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> were the Tyrannical Magiſtrates, and their bloody minded covetous Prieſts, which committed ſpiritual wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs together in high places.</p>
               <p n="23">23 Again, you choſen ones may know, though the bodies of the Saints ſuffer impriſonment or death for the truth of Chriſt, yet their ſpirits are in pure peace, and at perfect liberty in life and death.</p>

               <p n="26">26 Again, ſeeing <hi>John</hi> by a divine light ſaw the ſouls of them that were put to death for bearing witneſs to the word of God, or ſpiritual truth of Jeſus, reigning with Chriſt over the raging ſpirits of their bloody perſecutors, that thouſand years time of the Ten per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions aforeſaid: My ſpiritual brethren, what was that worſhip of the beaſt, and receiving his mark in their fore-heads and hands, which they were preſerved from in the thouſand years reign, or time of their fiery tryals for the name of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt? that is, they were delivered from that idolatrous worſhip, proceeding from the beaſtly imagination of their ſpiritual bloody Tyrants, as afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, not daring in the leaſt to handle any carnal weapons in defence of their curſed inventions, what ſufferings ſoever they endured.</p>

               <p n="32">32 It remains now that I ſhould write ſomewhat concerning his being looſed out of his priſon, that you may the better underſtand the truth in relation to the dead men aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="33">33 Moreover, you that have been well acquainted with ſpiritual conditions, cannot but know, that no men in the world are in ſuch a deep priſon of raging darkneſs, as thoſe men that tyrannize over the conſciences of innocent ſouls, which cannot bow down to their ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary divine ordinances.</p>
               <p n="34">34 Furthermote you may alſo know, that when the Magiſtrate and his pretended Prophets were prevented from perſecuting mens per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, in reference to their conſciences towards God, then, and not till then was Satan looſed out of his priſon.</p>
               <p n="35">35 This was that looſing of Satan for a little ſeaſon out of his unſpeakable priſon in the temporal powers, when the innocent pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of Chriſt had freedom of conſcience in reference to their faith in the Lord of Glory, through which the Chriſtians were multiplied again in the earth.</p>
               <p n="36">36 Again, you may know that it was but a very little ſeaſon ſince Chriſt was glorified, that the Saints poſſeſſed any ſuch ſpiritual free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in any kingdom under heaven;</p>

               <p n="38">38 Moreover, though the name of Chriſt was almoſt extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the face of the earth in the thouſand years ſpiritual reign of the Saints and raging of the ſerpents, as aforeſaid, yet you may know in that ſeaſon of liberty of Chriſtian conſcience, that the Saints were mightily increaſed again in the world.</p>
               <p n="39">39 Furthermore you may alſo know, that thoſe Saints are the dead men that lived not again until theſe laſt times of the inviſible

               </argument>
               <p>MY beloved brethren, in the unerring ſpirit you may know, there is a twofold appearing of Chriſts glory in his choſen ones, as the glory of the Sun excels the glory of the Moon, ſo theſe two glories tranſcend each other.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Moreover, you know the Moon appears in the brightneſs of her glory at one time, and at another time ſhe appears altogether like unto darkneſs or ſhame:</p>
               <p n="3">3 So likewiſe it is with Chriſts appearing in glory to mens ſouls in this life, ſometimes by vertue of the in-comes of his eternal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:103084:95"/>the ſoul of man for a moment is tranſmuted into the glorious likeneſs of the divine Majeſty himſelf;</p>
               <p n="4">4 But at another time you know, when none of theſe ſpiritual lightnings appear through ſome fleſhly guilt, the poor ſoul ſeems to be full of fearful darkneſs, horror, and ſhame, as if it had never ſeen any light or life at all.</p>
               <p n="5">5 So that you ſee all the glory of Chriſts appearing unto the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of men in this life, is but a changeable Moon-like glory at the beſt;</p>
               <p n="6">6 Therefore it can be but a ſpiritual type of this perſonal appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Chriſt in his judgement-ſeat, glory with all his mighty Angels.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Again, you know the Sun is no way ſubject to change in the leaſt, but Gyant-like runs his courſe in four and twenty hours through the whole heavens, and in one place or other appears in his glory unto the end of all time:</p>
               <p n="8">8 So likewiſe you may know it is with this perſonal appearing of Chriſt in his glory with his holy Angels, for in that day of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing the perſons of his redeemed ones ſhall be nothing elſe but Sun-ſhine, like divine glories in themſelves, and ſo run their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly courſe even to all eternity.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Who ever thou art that is ignorant of this perſonal glory of Chriſts coming in the clouds, or air, with his elect Angels, to make an eternal ſeparation between the perſons of the bleſſed Iſraelites, and curſed Cananites, though thou art full of ſeeming glorious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions concerning a God or Chriſt, living in mens conſciences, yet thou canſt never be firmly eſtabliſhed, until thou knoweſt that perſonal God, or Chriſt, ſitting in the throne of his infinite glory in the high heavens without thee, from whence alone all inward light or life proceeds.</p>
               <p n="10">10 I confeſs if a man become an innocent merciful ſpirit, he may be able to ſpeak ſuch a language from a ſuppoſed God or Chriſt in mens conſciences onely, that may confound the ſeeming holineſs of all Church fellowſhips in the world;</p>
               <p n="11">11 But what advnatage is this to himſelf, or his heirs, except when he is confounded, in the room thereof he doth not onely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the effects of Chriſts truth in the minds of men, but is able to demonſtrate in ſome meaſure the perſonal appearing of Chriſt in his glory in the world to come?</p>
               <p n="12">12 If the viſible appearing of a glorified God or Chriſt in the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:103084:95"/>perſon of a man be ſuch a choak-pear unto thee, or ſeem low or carnal, becauſe the national Prieſts confeſs ſuch a like thing;</p>
               <p n="13">13 I would fain know of thee by ſober ſpeaking or writing, where thy God or Chriſt is become, when thy ſoul, and all thy light, or life, for a moment is become ſilent death, or darkneſs, with thy body of duſt?</p>
               <p n="14">14 Moreover, if thou underſtandeſt not a perſonal God or Chriſt too tranſcendent glorious for Heavens, Earth, Angels, or Men, to be capable of the indwelling of his eternal ſpirit, what is thy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God or Chriſt thou diſcourſeſt ſo much about, but pleaſant words or periſhing nature onely?</p>
               <p n="15">15 Furthermore, if thou knoweſt this wonderful ſecret concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what a ſpirit is, then wouldſt thou certainly know how impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a thing it is, for any ſpirit whatſoever, to poſſeſs a living being without a diſtinct body of his own.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Again, of what bigneſs doſt thou think a ſpirit is, whether it be finite or infinite? give me leave to write a little of this ſtrange thing from thoſe ſayings of Chriſt to his diſciples in the 17. Chapter by St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> the words are theſe, <hi>For verily I ſay unto you, for if ye have faith as much as is a grain of Muſtard ſeed, ye ſhall ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove: and nothing ſhall be unpoſſible unto you.</hi> Behold, is not a grain of Muſtard ſeed a very little? and yet you ſee Chriſt ſaith nothing ſhould be unpoſſible unto that man that hath ſuch a quantity of ſpiritual faith in him.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Again, it is written, <hi>with God nothing ſhall be unpoſſible:</hi> who then is capable to poſſeſs ſo much faith in him as will contain the quantity of a Muſtard ſeed, but Chriſt Jeſus the God of Glory him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, unto whom all things are poſſible, that he is moved unto by that ſeed of faith, which is the eternal ſpirit of his glorified perſon?</p>
               <p n="18">18 Moreover, if a ſpirit be in its quantity but as a grain of Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtard ſeed, or a ſpark of fire, how then is it poſſible for the Spirit of God, Men, or Angels, to poſſeſs any ſenſible light, life, joy or glory, but in their own bodies onely?</p>
               <p n="19">19 Furthermore, if this deſcription of a ſpirit ſeem ſtrange, be it known unto thee, the Lord hath made me to declare it, for the confounding of that curſed error of Gods eſſentially being in all things.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Again, if the eternal ſpirit ſhould conſiſt of ſo great a bulk,
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:103084:96"/>how then can there be any God at all, but nature onely?</p>
               <p n="21">21 Or how can it poſſibly be an infinite ſpirit, when it is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct to it ſelf, but is compelled to have its being in finite things onely? this unknown bodileſs God is much like unto the Star-gazers monſtrous Sun and Moon aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="22">22 Is not this infiniteneſs indeed for all the ſpirits of elect men and Angels, to be filled with variety of divine glories, with one word ſpeaking from ſo ſmall a fiery glory as this is?</p>
               <p n="23">23 Who ever thou art that ſhall be left to deſpiſe this little ſpark of immortal Crowns, which eſſentially raigneth in the man Chriſt Jeſus alone, it is becauſe there is no true light of life in thee.</p>

               <p n="2">2 My Chriſtian friends, why did <hi>John</hi> call it a great white Throne, which he ſpiritually ſaw? It was becauſe of the glorious brightneſs of the Judges face, or perſon, and his Angelical atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, and alſo becauſe it was the dreadful general appearance of mankinde, to receive their eternal dooms.</p>
               <p n="3">3 You know when Chriſt was transfigured upon the Mount, through which his face ſhone, and his garments glittered, the Texts ſaith, that <hi>Moſes and Elias appeared to him in glory:</hi>

               <p n="4">4 So likewiſe you may know, that <hi>John</hi> called it a great white Throne, as beforeſaid, becauſe of the tranſcendent brightneſs of Chriſts perſon.</p>
               <p n="5">5 What heaven and earth was that which fled away from his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious face? what ever men imagine to the contrary, you that are ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:103084:96"/>may know, that it was the diſſolution of that heaven and earth that had a beginning, as if it had never had any being, I mean this viſible firmamental heaven and earth, and all light or life in them.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Therefore where <hi>John</hi> ſaith, <hi>their place was no more found,</hi> that was ſpoken in reference unto their former natural brightneſs, vertue, beauty, power, or glory, being tranſlated into a Chaos of everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confuſion.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Again, beſides the glorious brightneſs of Chriſts perſon, and his Angelical Hoſt, give me leave to write a little more of that great white Throne which <hi>John</hi> ſaw.</p>
               <p n="8">8 You that are truly ſpiritual, cannot be ſo groſly ignorant, as to think, that Chriſt hath no other Throne to inhabit in but his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſpirits, and this natural world onely: why? becauſe that error ariſeth out of the Atheiſtical hearts of fleſhly men, that hath no faith in the truth of Holy Writ.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Moreover, if mens ſpirits be but rationally ſober, though at preſent they be never ſo atheiſtical, they may be convinc'd that there is another world beſides this, which is of a higher nature compaſſing this Globe round about, and yet it is not global as this is, onely there is no elementary Firmament, Sun, Moon, nor Stars in it, but it is an open place, City, Throne, or Kingdom, of infinite vaſtneſs in length, breadth, or height, anſwerable to the perſon of an infinite Majeſty.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Alſo it is a Throne of exceeding whiteneſs, or Sun-like bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſuitable unto the tranſcendent brightneſs of the Kings perſon that ſits thereon, and his glorious companions.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Though the joy and glory of an earthly Prince conſiſts chiefly in the greatneſs of his perſon, power, vaſt territories, and honorable ſubjects for his ſafety, yet for all this, you know, that his palaces are deckt with embroidered Ornaments of gold, ſilver, precious ſtones, and ſuch like, for the further ſetting forth the mortal glory of his Princely Majeſty:</p>

               <p n="16">16 Moreover, if the eternal Majeſty be infinite, or boundleſs, as he is, I would fain know of any man, how it is poſſible for a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied infinite ſpirit, or perſon, to be contained in a finite bounded world?</p>
               <p n="17">17 Though the Doves of divine glory are compelled for a ſeaſon, to live among the Tyrannical Serpents of this periſhing world, yet I would have you to underſtand, that if an infinite, or boundleſs God, with his mighty Angels, ſhould have no other Throne to ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace themſelves in but this, then in ſtead of ſpiritual liberty, they would all be in natural bondage;</p>
               <p n="18">18 If you ask me the reaſon of it, you may know, that the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied perſon of God, or Chriſt, is of a motion ſwifter then thought, and the perſons of <hi>Moſes, Elias,</hi> and the mighty Angels, are of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as ſwift as thought;</p>
               <p n="19">19 Therefore no incloſed place can contain them, but they muſt of neceſſity inhabit a Throne, or Kingdom of infinite vaſtneſs, for aſcending, or deſcending at the divine pleaſure, according to their motional ſwiftneſs.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Again, you ſpiritual ones may undoubtedly know that there is ſuch a throne as I ſpeak of, why? becauſe this world cannot poſſibly contain our thoughts, but they nimbly pierce through the heavens, and in a weak meaſure they comprehend an infinite, or boundleſs God, and a Throne, or Kingdom of an infinite circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>
               <p n="21">21 If our bodies were anſwerable to our thoughts, this world could not poſſibly contain them, but they would aſcend through the natural heavens, to ſee whether there were ſuch a vaſt kingdom of eternal glory, as they had apprehended.</p>

                     <hi>1</hi> The Creators withholding of his divine aſſiſtance, was the cauſe of the Fall of our firſt Parents. <hi>2</hi> The ground of all ſpiritual or natural Curſes. <hi>3</hi> Noahs Ark aſſimulated to Heaven. <hi>4</hi> Of the Reſurrection.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>YOu that are full of the light of life may know, that whileſt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> continued in the purity of their Creation, this whole earth and all things made therein, were as pure in their kinde and meaſure, as that vaſt kingdom of glory, and all that therein is.</p>
               <p n="2">2 Moreover, as ſoon as ever their pure natures were defiled with the Serpentine nature of fiery luſt, you know the whole earth and all things therein, had a curſe upon them in one kinde or another.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Furthermore, you may know that this curſe did in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:103084:99"/>extend unto the very ſouls and bodies of all creatures, with the whole world throughout.</p>
               <p n="4">4 Some men may ſay unto me, <hi>Seeing the divine nature is all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it ſelf, what was that curſe upon the while Creation? or whence came it, ſeeing they were uncapable of ſin or evil in the leaſt?</hi> From the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erring Spirit to this I anſwer, It was not an infuſion of any curſe or evil into the natures of any thing by the Creator, but it was a withholding the motions of its firſt created bleſſedneſs, through which naturally it became barren or curſed in it ſelf, this was the fruit of unlawful luſt.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Moreover, that you may clearly underſtand wherein the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing or curſing of the Lord conſiſts, you may know that when he wholly denies the heavenly motion of his holy Spirit unto a man, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately that ſoul becomes nothing but curſed envy againſt all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual or natural purity whatſoever:</p>
               <p n="6">6 So likewiſe when he denies the natural motions of his bleſſed Spirit unto any thing that he hath made, it becomes ſubject to all kinde of putrifaction whatſoever: this was that curſing of the Jews natural bleſſings, and hardening of <hi>Pharaohs</hi> heart, by the Lord ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in Holy Writ.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Thus you that are ſober may clearly ſee the ground of all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual or natural curſings in the whole Creation; for though it was pronounced through the ſpiritual mouth of the Creator himſelf, yet it could not poſſibly proceed from that word of the Lords ſpeaking, becauſe of the glorious purity of his divine nature, but that curſe roſe out of the natures of the creatures themſelves, for want of the motions of the ſpirit of God in them, as beforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Again you that are ſpiritual know, that immediately after the Lord ſaid, <hi>an end of all fleſh was come before him,</hi> when <hi>Noah</hi> and his family, and the Creation, were entred into the Ark, the whole world of luſtful men and women, and the glory thereof, were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed by water: now you know all that was in the Ark was ſecured from the raging waters through their aſcending above the waters.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Moreover you may know that the Ark, and thoſe creatures therein, were not onely preſerved for the increaſe of a new world, but they were alſo a figure of a world to come.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Furthermore, the Ark it ſelf had relation unto that Kingdom of Glory in the high Heavens, which is too ſublime to be overtopped by any natural water, or ſire whatſoever.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:103084:99"/>
               <p n="11">11 The perſon of <hi>Noah,</hi> who was made a Preacher of truth and righteouſneſs to the unbelieving world, did repreſent the perſon of that ſpiritual preacher of all truth and righteouſneſs in the heavenly Ark beforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Furthermore, the other perſons and creatures in the Ark had reference unto the ſalvation of the elect of God, and the whole creation that are in being at the perſonal appearing of Chriſt in his Glory, with his mighty Angels.</p>
               <p n="13">13 The drowning of the whole world of ungodly men, and the reſt of the creation, had relation unto the eternal condemnation of all Reprobate men in this world;</p>
               <p n="14">14 The burning up of their natural delights wherewith they ſport themſelves in exceſs of riot and drunkenneſs, little thinking of that eternal vengeance coming upon them.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Again, righteous <hi>Noah</hi> repreſented the divine judge of ungodly men in this, becauſe he entred into the Ark, and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of a great light in him, he was made to ſit as a judge in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of wicked men, when the waters roſe upon them, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of their laughing him to ſcorn about his Ark, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ſecurity in the Ark, and their preſent deſtruction by water, having no Ark of refuge to deliver them.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Moreover, as they ſported themſelves in fleſhly filthineſs, and vain glorious mirth about him, his Ark, pure language, and life:</p>
               <p n="17">17 So likewiſe as a mighty Prince in his Chariot tramples rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ſubjects with delight under his horſes heels, he rode in his Ark as in a Chariot, triumphing in the Lord for his own deliverance, and their deſtruction under the feet of his Ark, as a juſt recompence of their unrighteous deeds, and deſpiſing the Lord and his truth, which he had declared to them for a long ſeaſon.</p>
               <p n="18">18 As ſure as the Lord liveth, thus it will be very ſuddenly with this luſtful bloody world, that ſports themſelves about the reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the dead and judgement day, ſaying, <hi>it is paſt already,</hi> or, <hi>there will never be any ſuch thing;</hi> for that righteous <hi>Noah,</hi> the King of Glory will open the Firmament of Heaven, and ſtand in the air with his mighty Angels, ſurrounding his perſon, and by the power of his word ſpeaking, as he raiſed <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the grave;</p>
               <p n="19">19 So likewiſe I affirm againſt men or Angels, the very ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and no other, which did that deed, is that God that will by his word ſpeaking command all his righteous <hi>Noahs,</hi> both dead and alive,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:103084:100"/>bodily to a aſcend into that holy Ark of eternal glory in the high Heavens, and when they are ſafely arrived with the whole crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which according to their kinde groaned long for deliverance; then as beforeſaid that mighty God the man Jeſus in glory, with a flood of fire will burn all the beauty, or glory of this world to aſhes, leaving all curſed Cananites, bodies and ſpirits, burning together like fire and brimſtone upon this earth in utter darkneſs, anſwerable unto their former burning luſts in their natural conditions.</p>
               <p n="20">20 Moreover, thoſe men and women that glory of a God or Chriſt within them, and what ever filthineſs they act, charge the moſt Holy Spirit with it, I ſay from the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, though they ſcape the vengeance of men by their Satannical ſubtilties, yet in the remembrance of their deſpiſings of a glory or miſery to come, in that day the divine vengeance ſhall burn more fiery hot in their ſouls and bodies then all other men whatſoever.</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IF there be ſuch a dreadful day of Chriſts perſonal appearing in his glory with his mighty Angels, ſome men may ſay unto me, may it not be a long ſeaſon, are there not many prophecies yet to be fulfilled, before his coming, as the calling of the Jews, and the ſign of the Son of Man in Heaven, and ſuch like?</p>
               <p n="2">2 From an unerring ſpirit, to this I anſwer, As <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt was the laſt Prophet under the Law, and the forerunner of the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den appearing of Chriſt Jeſus the Lord in a body of fleſh;</p>
               <pb n="191" facs="tcp:103084:100"/>
               <p n="3">3 So likewiſe I poſitively affirm againſt all gain-ſayers under hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that I <hi>John Reeve,</hi> am the laſt commiſſionated Prophet that ever ſhall declare divine ſecrets, according to the foundation of truth, until the Lord Jeſus Chriſt appear on his Throne of glory, viſibly to be ſeen by all his elect face to face.</p>
               <p n="4">4 But of the contrary, in that day of our God and King of glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Crowns appearing, none of thoſe curſed men and women, which blaſphemouſly ſaid, that God hath no perſon at all, ſhall ever be able to behold his face, and live; but according to Holy Writ, they ſhall cry to the Mountains, Hills, or Rocks, to hide them from the wrath of his bright burning body, or face, that ſits upon the Throne.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Concerning a general viſible calling of the Jews in all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, to the acknowledgement of Chriſt being come in the fleſh, I ſay from the eternal ſpirit that ſent me, that there will never be any ſuch thing in the world; indeed the Miniſterial Artiſts have of a long ſeaſon imagined an outward call of the Jews, to their vain glorious ſeeming holineſs, but the moſt Wiſe and Holy God intends no ſuch thing.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Wherefore to confound their carnal wiſdom, his glorious pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe is to call home to himſelf thoſe Jews and Gentiles, elected to everlaſting life by the inviſible teaching of his moſt Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="7">7 You that are ſober may come to underſtand that there is two ſort of Jews, there is a Moſaical Jew, and an Apoſtolical Jew.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Moreover you may know, that thoſe men called <hi>Independents, Annabaptiſts, Presbyterians,</hi> are the literal Apoſtolical Jews.</p>
               <p n="9">9 And thoſe men that obſerve Saturday for their Sabbath, are thoſe Moſaical legal Jews, which utterly deny that Chriſt is yet come in the fleſh, but ignorantly expect his appearing in a fleſhly glorious manner, to raign over them in the Throne of <hi>David</hi> his Father.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Moreover theſe Sabbattical Saturday Jews, <hi>John Tanee</hi> like, do imagine when their fleſhly Chriſt appears to raign over them, that he will gather them out of all nations wherein they are ſcattered, and conduct them into the inheritance of their fathers, that promiſed Land of <hi>Canaan;</hi> and there they make account with their imaginary King to live in a temporal glorious condition for a long ſeaſon; and as they have been ſervants and ſlaves to all Nations wherein they were ſcattered, ſo likewiſe as a reward of their ſervitude, they fully expect that all Nations ſhall bow down to them, and bring in their
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:103084:101"/>riches and glory unto them, as their vaſſals for ever.</p>
               <p n="11">11 You that are ſpiritual, may know, that theſe unbelieving Moſaical Jews, which expect a carnal Chriſt to raign over them, were thoſe Jews which at the death of Chriſt ſaid, <hi>his blood be upon us and our children;</hi> and truly you know his blood was upon them, and their children to ſome purpoſe, in the deſtruction of <hi>Hieruſalem,</hi> and unto this day, yea, and ſo it will be to the end of the world.</p>
               <p n="12">For the Lord Jeſus will never ſpiritually gather the ſeed of thoſe Jews, which rated a bloody <hi>Barabas</hi> above the Lord of life himſelf.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Moreover thoſe Jews which were afraid of having any hand in the death of Chriſt, were the fathers of thoſe ſpiritual Jews in all Nations, that are mixed in marriages with the Gentiles, whoſe merciful innocent ſpirits are delivered from all tyranny over mens conſciences.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Furthermore, thoſe <hi>Independent, Annabaptiſt, Presbyterian</hi> men, which hold it lawful, juſt and good, to perſecute men in their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and eſtates upon a ſpiritual account, I ſay from the eternal ſpirit, that they are for the moſt part the off-ſpring of thoſe bloody-minded Jews that crucified the Lord of Glory upon the account of blaſphemy, as beforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="15">15 O bleſſed are all unperſecuting merciful minded men and women onely!</p>
               <p n="16">16 All innocent, merciful <hi>Independent, Annabaptiſt, Presbyterian</hi> men, or women, that are preſerved from a perſecuting minde of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine things which ſeem difficult, from the eternal ſpirit I declare, thoſe are part of Gods ſpiritual wheat, which are mixed with the chaffy Jews and Gentiles, which are the off-ſpring of curſed <hi>Cain,</hi> whom the Lord ſhall burn with unquenchable fire, when he cometh in his Glory with his Angels, to receive his ſpiritual wheat into his heavenly barn, as aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="17">17 Thus you that are ſpiritually enlightned from on high, may clearly ſee, that the calling of the elect Jews in all nations unto the knowledge of the divine Majeſty, and his heavenly truths, was not meant an outward calling of them from a Moſaical legallity, unto an Apoſtolical literallity, as many men have vainly imagined, but it was an inward calling of them by the motions of the eternal ſpirit, to the right underſtanding of the one perſonal Majeſty on the Throne of Glory, and his heavenly truths.</p>

               <p n="18">18 Again, concerning the ſign of the Son of Man in heaven, in the 24. of <hi>Matthew</hi> and the 30. it is thus written, <hi>And then ſhall appear the ſign of the Son of Man in heaven, and then ſhall all the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred of the earth mourn, and they ſhall ſee the Son of Man come in the Clouds of heaven with power and great glory;</hi> this ſign of the Son of Man was that ſubſtance, or very Son of Man himſelf, and the glory of his perſonal appearing in the Clouds of Heaven with his glittering Angels, cauſed ſuch a fiery brightneſs, not onely in the viſible Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens above, but the whole earth beneath alſo appeareth like a flame of fire, or burning lightning, inſomuch that all the kindreds of the earth, which never expected that dreadful day, becauſe their perſons were not tranſmuted into the divine likeneſs of the Son of Man.</p>
               <p n="19">19 Therefore their unbelieving earthly ſpirits did quake and tremble, lament and howl like dogs, for very fear of the foreſaid ſign of the Son of Man ſhould rend them to pieces, and burn them and their inward God, or Chriſt, to powder; I mean all thoſe which gloried of a God or Chriſt within them onely, and curſedly deſpiſed this perſonal God on his glorious Throne without them.</p>

               <p n="23">23 Moreover, you know it is ſaid, <hi>As it was in the days of Noah, and in the days of Lot, ſo it ſhall be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed.</hi>

               <p n="24">24 Furthermore, you know the Scripture ſaith, <hi>They were eating and drinking and marrying of wives, and planting, and building, unto the day that Noah entred into the Ark; but in the day that Lot went

               <p n="4">4 Again, you know it is written, <hi>That in the day Lot departed out of Sodom it rained fire and brimſtone, and deſtroyed them all;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, what a dreadful and ſudden deſolation fire maketh in a mortal world, even within a dayes compaſs!</p>
               <p n="5">5 So likewiſe it ſhall be when the Son of man appears in his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for within the compaſs of a day, or twelve hours, after mans ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, the heavens without the body of man ſhall be melted with fervent heat, and in ſtead of the former and latter ſhowers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to nouriſh the earth, and rejoyce mans heart, as a flood of fire and brimſtone, it ſhall pour it ſelf upon the whole world, and burn all the beauty, vertue, or glory thereof to duſt, or powder, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid.</p>
               <p n="6">6 I write not againſt the truths of the Scriptures, but by inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from the Holy Spirit, I bear record to the mind of God in them, in oppoſition of all pretended ſpiritual lights under heaven:</p>
               <p n="7">7 Wherefore as an eternal witneſs againſt all ſorts of men that wreſt the Scriptures to their own hurt, give me leave to recite that threefold teſtimony of <hi>Peter,</hi> as a ſeal to this glorious truth, that ſhall burn like fire and brimſtone in them that deſpiſe it: the words are theſe. <hi>But the heavens and earth which are now, are kept by the ſame word in ſtore, and reſerved unto fire againſt the day of condemnation, and of the deſtruction of ungodly men, but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night, in the which the heavens ſhall paſs away with a noiſe, and the Elements ſhall melt with heat, and the earth with the works that are therein, ſhall be burnt up, looking for and haſting unto the coming of that day of God, by the which the heavens being on fire, ſhall be diſſolved, and the Elements ſhall melt with heat; a threefold cord is not eaſily broken.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="8">8 If any Hypocrite ſhall go about by his Serpentine Sophiſtry, to tell you that are ſpiritually weak, thoſe ſayings of <hi>Peter</hi> had rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the burning up of the carnal heavens and earth in men,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:103084:104"/>through the glorious appearing of the eternal ſpirit, you may with eaſe confute thoſe notional cheats, if you look back upon the ground of <hi>Peters</hi> ſayings: the words are theſe, <hi>knowing this firſt that there ſhall come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, and ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming, for ſince the fathers fell aſleep, all things continue as they were from the beginning of the creation, for this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the Word of God the heavens were of old, and the earth ſtanding out of the water, and in the water, whereby the world then was overflowed with water, periſhed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="9">9 Thus you that have never ſo little truth of the true Jeſus in you, may clearly ſee, that the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in this threefold lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, had not the leaſt thought in him concerning heavens and earth being burnt up within men, but the burning up of the heavens and earth, and the beauty, vertue, or glory thereof without man, which were the fruits of mans handy-works; why? becauſe you ſee the Apoſtle grounds his matter upon the drowning of an outward earthly world.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Moreover, you may alſo know, that it was a burning up of a viſible heaven and earth, and the glory thereof meant by <hi>Peter,</hi> why? becauſe the Apoſtle tells you, <hi>that there ſhall come in the laſt days ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts, and ſaying, where is the promiſe of his coming?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="11">11 Furthermore, if it had been an inviſible burning up the fleſhly heavens in men onely, what luſtful man in the world would have ſcoffed at ſuch a doctrine, which did encourage him in his luſts, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then diſcourage him in the leaſt?</p>
               <p n="12">12 If you ask me the reaſon, my ground is this, becauſe by luſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Serpents like himſelf, he was perſwaded that Chriſt will burn up mens luſts, and ſave all their ſouls at the laſt, and who can finde fault with ſuch a burning doctrine? or wha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="13">13 Again, you may know I have written the truth by this token, why? becauſe men that are guilty of almoſt all maner of luſts, can go into Lumber ſtreet to hear men ſpeak much concerning the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious incoming of a ſpiritual Chriſt, to burn up all their fleſhly or heavenly conceitedneſs, that they may ſee nothing in them but God onely triumphing on his Throne, I ſay theſe or ſuch like ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions the moſt filthieſt of men can hear with delight.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:103084:105"/>
               <p n="14">14 Moreover, if you that ſpeak in Lumber-ſtreet, or elſe where ſhould once attain to the foundation of all ſpiritual ſpeaking, and ſhould be able knowingly to tell men of the ſudden appearing of the Son of Man in Glory with his Angels, to burn this viſible world to aſhes, and to cauſe the ſpirits and bodies of men that glory in filthineſs to burn as fire and brimſtone together to eternity in utter darkneſs; I am confident very few filthy perſons would be able to hear you ſpeak twice together, and then you would ſoon have a thin Congregation, and be as much affected as men are with us, for what we ſpeak in the name of the Lord.</p>
               <p n="15">15 What is the ground think you of ſo many dreadful fires this year in this City, and other parts, above the memory of man? I know with Aſtrologian Sophiſters you may impute it to Planets plot, or peoples want of care; but of the contrary I believe you Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ſign-mongers will finde theſe fires came not meerly by natural cauſes, but by a divine power as a forerunner of the eternal burning this world, and all the natural glory therein to duſt, powder, or dry ſand, as aforeſaid.</p>

               <p n="19">19 My beloved friends, who are poſſeſſed with a pure light, lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage and life, I am undoubtably perſwaded in my ſoul, that for a little ſeaſon I have both taſted and ſeen within my ſpirit, a greater meaſure of the eternal glory and ſhame to come, then any creature now living in this world;</p>
               <p n="20">20 Yet for all this and the continual ſupply which I receive from that fountain of glories, I know that the moſt eminent appearances in theſe bodies of clay, are but meer ſhadows in compariſon of that glory and ſhame, which many men ſhall poſſeſs <hi>when the Son of Man ſhall appear in his glory with his mighty Angels.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="21">21 If a man lie under the power of any luſt, how can that man

               <p n="22">22 Moreover, doth not a firſt reſurrection include a ſecond reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, how then can that man be thought to have part in this firſt reſurrection, which vainly boaſts that he is poſſeſſed with the ſecond reſurrection of glory with a Chriſt already?</p>
               <p n="23">23 Furthermore, you ſee that the Apoſtle never boaſted that he was glorified with Chriſt already, neither did he expect any glory, but rather continual ſhame until Chriſt did perſonally appear to change his vile body into the likeneſs of his glorious body.

               <p n="24">24 Moreover, did Chriſt reign on the Throne of his Glory with his Angels, <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> till he had ſuffered under a thorny Crown of unutterable cruelties unto death it ſelf, and was riſen from the dead?</p>

               </argument>
               <p>IN the next place give me leave to write a little of the new birth, or firſt reſurrection from a glorified Chriſt.</p>
               <p n="2">2 What is this firſt reſurrection, that who ever hath part in it is bleſſed and holy, and the ſecond death hath no power? Truly it is the enjoyment of a divine light in the underſtanding which a man hath received by inſpiration from the ſpirit of a perſonal Chriſt on a throne of glory in the third Heavens.</p>
               <pb n="200" facs="tcp:103084:106"/>
               <p n="3">3 How ſhall a man truly know whether he hath this light in him or no, or when he received it? He that hath this light of Chriſt in him, his very thoughts, deſires, and affections, are by the power of it wholly bent upon all ſpiritual and natural purity whatſoever.</p>
               <p n="4">4 So that the Scriptures imputes Juſtice, Righteouſneſs, Holineſs, or Perfection unto that man onely which hath this light in him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is principally guided by a light which he hath received from the glorious God of all divine perfections without him.</p>
               <p n="5">5 Moreover, this light of Chriſt ſometimes is known by a glorious voice to the hearing of the ear, through which a man is ſo full of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward joy, glory, or majeſty in himſelf, that he knows not for that preſent whether he be in the condition of a God, or a man; this I certainly know, yet I believe few of the Saints themſelves have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of this condition.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Furthermore, this light of Chriſt conveys it ſelf ſo ſecretly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the underſtandings of moſt of his redeemed ones, by a low voice of his moſt Holy Spirit, that oftentimes they know not the time thereof; onely after this light of life hath once appeared, the ſoul is ſo delighted with it, that it thinks it can never have too much of it, or hardly enough of it; therefore like a woman in travail, it is full of hungring or thirſting after the knowledge of that Fountain of Glories from whence its light and joy proceeded.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Again, he that hath this light of Chriſt in him, is not onely full of longings after more of it, but his ſoul is alſo full of that new ſong of praiſe, honor, power and glory unto the infinite unknown God, until he doth in ſome meaſure truly know him.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Moreover, he that hath this new and true light, is not raſh in judging divine things he knows not, but by vertue of that light of life, he is preſerved with a meek and patient ſpirit to wait the Lords leiſure for manifeſting the truth thereof.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Furthermore, he that hath received this white Stone, or new Name of Chriſt to the purpoſe, ſees all the ſpeakings or writings of non-commiſſionated men but meer literal or notional emptineſs, in compariſon of that joy or glory that he poſſeſſeth from the inviſible motions of the divine Majeſty himſelf.</p>
               <p n="10">10 Again, by vertue of this light he is made able to diſcern whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſpeaking or writings proceed from a literal, notional, or ſpiritual Chriſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or no.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Moreover, he that hath this light of Chriſt thus grounded in
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:103084:106"/>him, doth not lie doting upon mens inviſible God, Chriſt, Spirit, Light, Life, Love, Joy, Beauty, Vertue, Power, or Glory, of meer words onely; but nothing will ſatisfie his new-born hungry ſpirit but a divine embracing of a perſonal God of ſpiritual ſubſtance, yea too tranſcendently glorious for men or Angels to be capable of the in-dwelling of his eternal Spirit, but of the in-ſhining vertues or motions onely.</p>
               <p n="12">12 So much at preſent concerning the firſt reſurrection or new birth, from a perſonal ſubſtantial God or Chriſt on the Throne of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity in the high heavens, in oppoſition of a ſuppoſed new birth from a notional inward Chriſt, or literal outward Chriſt onely.</p>

                     <hi>1</hi> Concerning Gods becoming a childe. <hi>2</hi> None lives, and moves, and have their beings in God, but the Seed of Faith. <hi>3</hi> No creature capable to be eſſentially one with God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AGain it is written, <hi>In him we live, and move, and have our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</hi> Alſo it is written, <hi>Bleſſed are the dead which die in the Lord.</hi> What did the Apoſtle mean by living in the Lord, and dying in the Lord? Or how can a man be ſaid to live in the Lord, and to die in the Lord alſo?</p>
               <p n="2">2 My ſpiritual friends, though all men have their life or being, in the Creator or in this power by vertue of creation, yet none but the elect do ſpiritually live, move, or have any being in him: and that is by vertue of redemption onely, and that was the occaſion of the Prophets ſaying, <hi>for unto us a childe is born, unto us a ſon is given:</hi> now you know that the Prophet ſpoke them words, long after the birth of that glorious babe, and yet you ſee that all his joy or glory, in reference to a life to come, was fixed onely in the perſon of that Childe.</p>
               <p n="3">3 Thus the Prophet, by vertue of the true Jeſus in him, did ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually live, and move, and had his being in the Lord of Hoſts, in a full aſſurance that God the everlaſting Father and Creator of both worlds, and all in them, would become a little childe for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of his elect from eternal death, by pouring forth of his moſt precious life: it is writted, <hi>who hath believed our report, or unto whom is the arm of the Lord revealed?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4 Thus you may ſee, that thoſe men which wanted the light of life in them, to receive that prophetical report, concerning the God of Glory's coming by the out-ſtretched arm of his eternal Spirit in a body of fleſh, to redeem the elect world to himſelf, were utterly ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:103084:107"/>of the Prophets ſpiritually living, moving, or being in the Lord.</p>
               <p n="5">5 So likewiſe this was the Apoſtle <hi>Pauls</hi> meaning alſo, when he ſaid <hi>for in him we live, and move, and have our being,</hi> according to that ſaying of his, <hi>for the life which I now live, is by the faith of the Son of God, which gave himſelf for me:</hi> Alſo you know it is written to this effect, <hi>that ſome men did live without God in the world;</hi> ſo that you may underſtand that reprobate men are accounted by the ſpirit of the Scriptures to live and to die in the devil, and to riſe again ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry devils in ſouls and bodies to all eternity.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The choſen of God are guided by the true light or love of Chriſt by vertue of that light, they are accounted to live and to die in the Lord, and to riſe again in the Lord both ſoul and body, becauſe of their God-like condition, even to all eternity.</p>
               <p n="7">7 Thus you that are filled with the light of the true Jeſus may clearly ſee, though a natural man by vertue of creation may be ſaid to live in, or by the power of the Lord, yet upon a ſpiritual account in reference to Redemption, he may be an abſolute devil in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and ſo wholly live in the dark power.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Moreover, though it is ſaid <hi>that the Saints live and die in the Lord,</hi> yet I would not have you think that the ſpirits of the Saints and the ſpirit of the Lord are ſo united, that they are but one eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial life or ſpirit; no, that was none of the Apoſtles intent in thoſe words: but as beforeſaid, his meaning was, that thoſe men which were poſſeſſed with the true light of life eternal, by a continual in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with the God of Glory from whence that light proceeded, they were vertually united unto the eternal Spirit.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Though the choſen of God are vertually united to the eternal ſpirit of a glorified Chriſt, yet how can it be ſaid they die in the Lord? or what is meant by their dying in the Lord? Truly moſt of the elect of God themſelves are dark in this thing, it is a ſealed book unto them, the Lord alone muſt open it.</p>
               <p n="10">10 My beloved brethren, as there is two lives of the elect in the Lord, a life of grace, and a life of glory, proceeding from one and the ſame ſpirit, onely differing much in degree; ſo likewiſe you may know there may be ſaid to be two deaths or dyings of the Saints in the Lord alſo.</p>
               <p n="11">11 Moreover, you know by vertue of the light of Chriſt in the new born of God, they become dead to all their former inward fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of fleſh and ſpirit, as namely, they are dead to covetouſneſs,
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:103084:107"/>envy, pride, luſt, yea and all exceſs of vain-glorious delights among men that periſh: ſo likewiſe they are dead to all their formal righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, or hypocritical holineſs, to be ſeen of men.</p>
               <p n="12">12 Moreover, they are dead to all carnal Chriſts in men whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, whether they be literal, natural, or notional Chriſts of empty words onely, ariſing onely from that blinde-born devil of mans ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary reaſons:</p>
               <p n="13">13 Furthermore, there is ſuch a ſelf-denying ſpirit in all experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental true born Chriſtians from the high heavens, that they abhor to put confidence in any God, Chriſt, Light, or Life, to give glory un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any thing that is in ſinful man or angels in the leaſt;</p>
               <p n="14">14 Becauſe they certainly know that there is not one motion or thought of any ſpiritual light or truth in man or angel, but what he received from an infinite glorious Majeſty, whoſe perſonal preſence is in a world where never any actual rebellions was committed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Thus in a ſmall meaſure, through divine aſſiſtance, I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you what is the firſt dying in the Lord, in reference to the firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from carnal darkneſs, to the true light of life in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, God-man bleſſed for ever and ever, Amen. Now give me leave to write a little of the ſecond and laſt dying in the Lord, becauſe of the eternal perſonal glory that will immediately follow it.</p>

                     <hi>1</hi> Of the ſecond and laſt dying in the Lord, <hi>2</hi> what it is. <hi>3</hi> Eternal life is hid in the perſon of God onely.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Know the general cheat of the Prieſts concerning this ſecret, for hey tell the ignorant people, that the body onely dies, and the ſoul aſcends to a place of bleſſedneſs, or deſcends to a place of cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſs until the day of Judgement, and they ſay then the ſoul aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumes the body again, and ſo receives the ſentence of eternal life and death, and ſo enters into heaven to the Lord, or hell with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and his angels, which they ſay are bodileſs ſpirits.</p>
               <p n="2">2 If the blinde lead the blinde, how can they ſcape falling into a ditch? this opinion of theirs is like unto moſt of their matters, but I'le paſs them by, and come to the thing in hand.</p>
               <p n="3">3 You that are ſpiritual may know, that to die in the Lord, is when a mans ſpirit dies in a full aſſurance of the reſurrection of his ſpirit and body again out of the duſt of the earth, by the ſpiritual power of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt at the laſt day.</p>
               <pb n="204" facs="tcp:103084:108"/>
               <p n="4">4 Furthermore, he that dies in the Lord, though all thats in him turns to duſt for a moment, yet before he entred into the ſilent ſleep of death, he knew who would raiſe him to life and glory a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain at the end of the time.</p>
               <p n="5">5 You know it is written, <hi>When Chriſt which is our life ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory;</hi> now you may know that the Apoſtle meant a perſonal glory that was eternal with Chriſt in his perſonal preſence, and not a particular ſpiritual glory in the elect, which was hid, and in ſtead of love occaſioned a general ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and perſecution of men, as a deluſion unto them, and the like.</p>
               <p n="6">6 Moreover, you know though the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was raviſht with more glorious incomes of the love of Chriſt, then the reſt of his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, yet he had many ſorrowful afflictions mixed with thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly raptures:</p>
               <p n="7">7 Therefore you may know if you are an heir of glory, that this appearing of Chriſt in glory to his ſuffering innocent people, was meant ſuch a like glory as he now poſſeſſeth himſelf in a Throne of eternity, where is neither hunger, nor thirſt, nor affliction of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor death, nor need of any Sun, Moon, or Stars, or any kinde of natural comforts for everlaſting.</p>
               <p n="8">8 Furthermore, though a man be full of the glorious incomes of the eternal ſpirit, yet you may know that his life is hid in that foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of ſpiritual enjoyments in the new heavens and earth above this whole globe, why? becauſe if a mans life, or glory, were hid in that light within them, then he would not onely be full of unmoveable conſolations, but he would alſo increaſe in himſelf with ſuch God-like wiſdom, power, and glory, that no envious man would be able to behold his face and live.</p>
               <p n="9">9 Though the light of Chriſt in his new born ones, occaſion much joy and peace of conſcience and power, to ſuffer perſecution for his names ſake; yet you may know, that the glory of that light might well be ſaid to be hid with God in Chriſt, becauſe the quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning power of his ſpiritual light in men or Angels, remains onely in his own perſon, which is the fountain or ſea of all heavenly glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as aforeſaid; <hi>Without me, ſaid Chriſt, ye can do nothing, ye are not ſufficient to think a good thought.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="10">10 You may know, that it is the glory of Chriſts glory, which compels him to keep the prerogative power of all his light, or life, in elect men and Angels to himſelf, that they may have no confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in the ſtrength of that light which is within them, but that
<pb n="205" facs="tcp:103084:108"/>they may caſt down the crowns of their ſpiritual confidences at the divine feet of his heavenly Majeſty, as the onely Author, Protector, and finiſher of their eternal bleſſedneſs.</p>
               <p n="11">11 So likewiſe it is with the elect alſo when they die in the Lord, for though the light of Chriſt was given them as a ſeal of his eternal love, that they might glory onely in the Lamb, and be enabled to wear his Crown of thorns to their lives end, as a preparative unto glorious Crowns at his appearing; yet I would have you for whom theſe thorns and Crowns are prepared, to underſtand, becauſe the life of all light, or glory you poſſeſs, are hid in the divine breaſt, or book of life with Chriſt in God;</p>
               <p n="12">12 Therefore when your ſoul comes to die, all your ſpiritual mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt enter into death alſo, until time be no more; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the power, wiſdom, and glory of Chriſt, will be ſeen in this thing above all his former works.</p>
               <p n="13">13 Again, he being the onely light and life of men, will not this be a Crown of glory to his infinite power? ſeeing the ſpirits of mankinde are mixt together in the ſea and earth in a marvelous man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, yet by a word ſpeaking he ſhall call his elect by name, as he did <hi>Lazarus,</hi> and they ſhall hear his voice, and come forth of their graves as one man, with diſtinct perſons all glorious, yet very fleſh and bone, and with thoſe elect then living, whoſe bodies ſhall be tranſmuted into glory alſo, aſcend as ſwift as thought to meet their God in the air, and ſit in Thrones of Judgement with him over all the Angels of darkneſs, remaining in this deſtroyed world for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</p>
               <p n="14">14 Moreover, if that error of mens bodies dying onely, and not ther ſouls, could poſſible be true, then no man could die, or be put to death at all; becauſe the life of mans body is his ſpirit, and but one ſpirit onely, though there is a double motion in it of contrary na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and effects by the ſecret decree of the Lord, for the manifeſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his eternal wiſedom, power, and glory, over the elect and Reprobate.</p>
               <p n="15">15 Thus you that are ſpiritual may ſee, what is meant by the Saints living and dying in the Lord, and concerning the place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge where their lives are hid both in life and in death, is not this truth anſwerable to thoſe ſayings of Chriſt himſelf in <hi>John? The words that I ſpeak unto you are ſpirit and life, I am the reſurrection and the life, he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet ſhall he live; and he that ſate upon the throne, ſaid behold, I make all things new,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:103084:109"/>the 20. <hi>and I will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> Again, <hi>Jeſus ſaid unto her, ſaid I not unto thee, that if thou didſt believe thou ſhouldſt ſee the glory of God?</hi> you know this was ſpoken by Chriſt, that God of all power, wiſdom, and glory, at his raiſing <hi>Lazarus</hi> from death to life.</p>
               <p n="16">16 Therefore you may know alſo, that the greateſt glory of all will redound to his infinite Majeſty, he ſhall ſhortly come in his glory with his mighty Angels, to call forth the living dead, to glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious bleſſedneſs, in the great white Throne, with himſelf, <hi>Moſes, Elias,</hi> and his Angels; and to call forth the dead, living, into ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful curſedneſs of ſouls and bodies in utter darkneſs, burning toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to eternity on this earth, where they poſſeſſed all their former glory, and acted their unrighteouſneſs againſt Chriſt and his redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ones, then will this Scripture be fulfilled: <hi>and they ſhall hear a great voice from heaven, ſaying unto them, come up hither, and they ſhall aſcend up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies ſhall ſee them,</hi> and theſe Scriptures.</p>

               <p n="6">6 Thus in ſome meaſure I have been made to declare unto my ſpiritual, yea and fleſhly brethren, alſo the ſudden, glorious, and dreadful appearing of the moſt high and mighty God-man, ſitting on the Throne of his Glory with his elect Angels, to judge both the quick and dead, according to his own ſayings in Holy Writ.</p>
               <p n="7">7 And now as a concluſion unto this Epiſtle, I ſhall ſpeak a few words to all that may peruſe it, in the name and power of our Lord Jeſus, by whoſe moſt bleſſed ſpirit I was inſpiringly moved to write it.</p>
